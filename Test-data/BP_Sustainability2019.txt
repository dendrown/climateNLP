This will  frame our thinking, our activities  and our interactions.
Introducing a new structure,   new leadership team and new   ways of working.
Our commitment to safe and reliable  operations remains unchanged.
And our investor proposition  remains unchanged.
Message from  Bernard Looney 2BP Sustainability Report 2019 BP Sustainability Report 2019 23for sustainable emissions reductions six  years ahead of schedule.
We know we have much more to do.
We want to help countries, cities and  corporations around the world decarbonize.
We want to support governments and   industry sectors around the world as  COP26 and the UN Biodiversity  Conference approach.
And we will   also be looking at how we can support  the ‚decade of delivery™ for the UN™s  Sustainable Development Goals.
To do   so, we need to ensure that as BP changes  we continue to perform as we transform.
We are committed to safe and reliable  operations, respecting our people and  the communities in which we work,   and delivering value to those who trust  us with their investment.
Helping the world get to net zero  and improving lives Our destination is now set and there is  no turning back.
We are aiming to be  trusted by society, valued by our   shareholders, and a motivating and  inspiring place to work for our employees.
We will need your support and challenge   to get there.
We may not get everything  right along the way and we will need to  listen and learn from others.
We are heading to a net zero future as a  thriving, sustainable energy business that  is a force for good in a low carbon world.
Bernard Looney Chief executive officer 27 March 2020 At the same time, I think it is important  to say that BP wants to change.
Not  only is it the right thing to do, it is a  tremendous business opportunity for us.
And that is because people everywhere  want the same thing: energy that is not  just reliable and affordable, but clean.
The world™s carbon budget is finite, and   it is running out fast, driven by the needs  and aspirations of society.
But we have  the skill and the will to help the world meet   this growing desire for cleaner energy.
That is what led us to adopt a new  purpose for BP, to reimagine energy for  people and our planet.
As our purpose   and ambition have changed, BP itself  must evolve.
So to enable us to deliver  our net zero ambition we are embarking   on a wide-ranging reorganization.
We are  reinventing BP to become more focused,  more integrated, and better equipped  to meet the world™s fast-changing  energy demands.
Rebuilding trust This is going to be a multi-year journey   and we know we cannot make it alone.
We will need the support of many  partners and open, constructive dialogue  with those willing to engage, challenge  and advise us.
I know many will doubt our intentions  and commitment.
So we aim to show   firmly and clearly the alignment between  what we say and what we do.
For  example, we will stop corporate  reputation advertising campaigns and  redirect resources to promote well-  designed climate policies and set new  expectations for our relationships with  trade associations.
And we aim to be   more transparent in our reporting,  including implementing the  recommendations of the Task Force on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures.
Building on strong foundations If you are familiar with this report,  you will know BP is not starting from   scratch with our low carbon ambition.
For  instance, we have major interests in solar  development, electric vehicle charging  and sustainable biofuels.
We have  expertise in low carbon developed over   decades, and this year we met our target  This is the first time I have written  the foreword to BP™s annual   sustainability report, and I do so   during an unprecedented global   health crisis.
The coronavirus   (COVID-19) pandemic is having a   huge impact on people™s lives, and   in many places it is having tragic   consequences too.
Where we can, BP has been making its  own contribution to efforts to deal with  the virus and our teams throughout the  world have been playing their part where   possible.
This includes providing free fuel  in the UK for emergency services and  donating $2 million to the World Health  Organization™s COVID-19 Solidarity  Response Fund.
For BP, the challenge   is also compounded by oil prices lower  than they have been for many years.
The year 2019 already seems like a long  time ago.
But the changes which were in  planning then, and which we announced  on 12 February this year, seem even  more important today.
BP now has a   new ambition to get to net zero by 2050  or sooner, and to help the world get to  net zero.
And I have immense confidence   in our business Œ both to get through the  current global crisis, and to meet our  longer-term ambition.
One reason for that confidence is the  foundation laid by my predecessor, Bob  Dudley.
In the past decade he has built  the strong foundations that are essential   if BP is to play its full part in supporting  a sustainable future for our world.
Reimagining energy, reinventing BP Our company is now entering a new   phase, yet it is a phase for which planning  has long been underway.
For several  months last year I went on the road with   a small team.
We met investors, partners,  policymakers, climate scientists,  development experts from non- governmental organizations, academics   Œ and many colleagues at BP.
From these conversations, all around  the world, we came away with one  inescapable conclusion.
BP has to   change, and faster than ever, because  the world is changing fast, and so are  society™s expectations of us.
BP Sustainability Report 2019 BP Sustainability Report 2019 23Introduction Sustainability at BP Our focus areas Doing business  responsibly  Governance Our reporting  Five aims to get BP to net zero Our ambition is to  become a net zero   company by 2050 or   sooner, and help the   world get to net zero.
Our ambition is supported by 10 aims: Aim 1 is to be net zero  across our entire operations  on an absolute basis by 2050  or sooner.
This aim relates to  Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions.
Read more about our  operational emissions   on  page 23 .Aim 2 is to be net zero on an  absolute basis across the  carbon in our upstream oil  and gas production by 2050  or sooner.
This aim relates   to Scope 3 emissions, and  is on a BP equity share basis  excluding Rosneft.
Read more about net zero   on  page 24 .Aim 3 is to cut the carbon   intensity of the products  we sell by 50% by 2050 or  sooner.
This is a lifecycle  carbon intensity approach,   per unit of energy.
It covers  marketing sales of energy  products and potentially, in   future, certain other products,  such as those associated  with land carbon projects.
Read more about net zero   on  page 24 .Aim 4 is to install methane   measurement at all our  existing major oil and gas  processing sites by 2023,   publish the data, and then  drive a 50% reduction in  methane intensity of our  operations.
And we will work  to in˚uence our joint ventures   to set their own methane  intensity targets of 0.2%.
Read more about methane   on  page 25 .Aim 5 is to increase the   proportion of investment  we make into our non-oil  and gas businesses.
Over  time, as investment goes up in  low and no carbon, we see it  going down in oil and gas.
4Five aims to help the world get to net zero Aim 6 is to more actively  advocate for policies that  support net zero, including  carbon pricing.
We will  stop corporate reputation  advertising campaigns and  re-direct resources to promote  well-designed climate policies.
In future, any corporate  advertising will be to push for   progressive climate policy;  communicate our net zero  ambition; invite ideas; or build  collaboration.
We will continue  to run recruitment campaigns  and advertise our products,  services and partnerships Œ   although we aim for these to  increasingly be low carbon.
Read more about advocacy  and lobbying on  page 71 .Aim 7 is to incentivize our  global workforce to deliver   on our aims and mobilize   them to become advocates  for net zero.
This will include  increasing the percentage of   remuneration linked to   emissions reductions for  leadership and around 37,000  employees.
Read more about   remuneration on   page 100 in the   BP Annual Report 2019 .Aim 8 is to set new  expectations for our   relationships with trade   associations around the  globe.
We will make the  case for our views on climate   change within the associations  we belong to and we will be  transparent where we differ.
And where we can™t reach   alignment, we will be prepared  to leave.
Read more about  trade associations  on  page 71  and online  bp.com/tradeassociations .Aim 9 is to be recognized  as an industry leader for   the transparency of our  reporting.
On 12 February  2020, we declared our support  for the recommendations of the  Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures.
We intend  to work constructively with  the TCFD and others Œ such  as the Sustainability Accounting   Standards Board (SASB) Œ  to develop good practices and  standards for transparency.
Read more about TCFD   online  bp.com/TCFD .Aim 10 is to launch a new  team to create integrated   clean energy and mobility  solutions.
The team will  help countries, cities and   corporations around the  world decarbonize.

BP Sustainability Report 2019 BP Sustainability Report 2019 67Introduction Megatrends The key trends affecting our businesses include:  growing global concern over climate change,   the impact of rapidly advancing digital technology,   increasing prosperity in the emerging world   driving economic growth, changing societal   expectations of corporations, and the shifting   geopolitical structure.
One of the key drivers of these trends is climate  change and the widening concern about the   energy transition.
The global energy system   needs to deliver more energy with less carbon.
Demand for energy is set to grow significantly,  driven by increases in prosperity in the developing   world.
Most of the growth in demand comes   from developing economies, to support their   industry and infrastructure and sustain   improvements in living standards.
Carbon emissions need to fall sharply as the  world seeks to move to a lower carbon energy   system consistent with meeting the climate   goals outlined in the Paris Agreement *.BP Energy Outlook 2019 Our Outlook explores the forces shaping the   global energy transition out to 2040 and the key   uncertainties surrounding it.
The 2019 Outlook   considers a range of scenarios.
They have some   common features, such as ongoing economic   growth and a shift towards a lower carbon fuel   mix, but differ in terms of policy, technology   and behavioural assumptions.
Scenarios Evolving transition:  assumes that government  policies, technology and social preferences   continue to evolve in a manner and speed seen   over the recent past.
Rapid transition:  envisages a more rapid  transition to a lower carbon energy system,  through a reduction in emissions stemming   from greater energy efficiency, fuel switching   and use of carbon capture, use and storage   (CCUS).
For more information see  bp.com/energyoutlook .
The  BP Energy Outlook 2020  will be published  later in the year.
The changing energy mix  Increased demand for energy will be met over   the coming decades through a diverse range of   supplies, including oil, gas, coal and renewables.
The energy mix is shifting as the transition to  a lower carbon energy system continues, with   renewable energy and natural gas gaining in   importance relative to oil and coal.
Scenarios Evolving transition:  renewables and natural  gas account for almost 85% of the growth in   primary energy by 2040, with their importance   increasing relative to all other sources of energy.
Rapid transition:  renewable energy grows  rapidly, accounting for more than the entire  increase in primary energy by 2040 Œ and a   sharp contraction in the use of coal.
The level of   oil consumption falls, but gas continues to grow   aided by increasing use of CCUS.

*  Paris Agreement    (1) Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement states the goal of ﬁHolding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the  temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.ﬂ  (2) Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible,  recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance  between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development  and efforts to eradicate poverty.
BP Sustainability Report 2019 BP Sustainability Report 2019 89There are many different pathways to  achieve the Paris goals * with substantial  variation in the implied energy mix.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) is the United Nations™ body   for assessing the science related to climate   change.
It is the leading source of data that   summarises the potential pathways to achieve   the Paris goals.
The IPCC compiles a database   of the published results on mitigation pathways   from modelling teams around the world.
The chart shows the range of modelled  pathways for carbon emissions from energy   and industrial use, collected by the IPCC,   that meet the long-term temperature goals in   the Paris Agreement, together with the paths   associated with two of BP™s own scenarios.
The ‚rapid transition™ scenario clearly sits   well within the range.
Also highlighted is the   ‚Sustainable Development Scenario™ from   the International Energy Agency (IEA SDS),   which is often cited as a reference case for a   scenario that is consistent with meeting the   Paris goals.

Ł The global economy more than doubles over   the next 25 years, with twice as much   economic activity in 2040 than we see today.
Ł The emergence of a large and growing   middle class, particularly in emerging Asia,   is an increasingly important force shaping   growth and energy trends.
Demand for energy is set to  grow   significantly Ł Global energy demand increases by about   20-35% by 2040 in the different scenarios.
Ł The vast majority of demand growth comes   from developing economies to support their   industry and infrastructure and allow living   standards to keep improving.
But carbon emissions need to fall sharply Ł There is a growing commitment to move to a   pathway consistent with meeting the climate   goals of the Paris Agreement *.Ł To help achieve this, the world needs to   transition to a lower carbon energy system.
The key dimensions of   the energy transition To meet the Paris goals, we believe the world   must take strong action on a range of fronts.
Improving energy efficiency, to   decouple energy demand growth   from growing prosperity.
Rapid growth in renewable energy and  other low or zero carbon energy sources.
Increasing the share of electricity in  final  energy use and decarbonizing  power  generation.
Switching to low or zero carbon liquid and  gaseous fuels, particularly in areas such  as  heavy transport.
Deploying carbon-removal technologies,  such as CCUS, at  scale.
Promoting natural climate solutions,   including the management and restoration  of habitats, and  the  role of offsets.
The pace at which the transition can be achieved  and the precise mix of elements is uncertain.
There are many possible pathways to meeting  the Paris goals and we use the different   scenarios to explore this uncertainty.

Safety   See  page 36 .Our value to society   See  page 42 .10UN Sustainable Development Goals  Stakeholders are increasingly looking to businesses to help address global  development challenges.
The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)   provide a global framework to help countries, businesses and other   stakeholders understand and address society™s most important challenges.
We want to contribute to sustainable   development and are working to do more   to support the delivery of the SDGs.
Our   business activity touches directly or indirectly   on many of the goals, but we™ve focused our   effort on specific goals that most closely   align with our current business strategy   and purpose.
These include affordable and   clean energy, decent work and economic   growth, and climate action.
We continue to look for opportunities to   do more to support the SDGs.
In 2020 we  plan to evaluate them alongside our new   strategic priorities, which we will provide   information about later in the year.
Working with others Through our membership of IPIECA, BP is   working with the World Business Council   for Sustainable Development on the   development of an SDG Sector Roadmap,   due for publication in 2020.
The Roadmap   aims to accelerate and optimize the   sector™s contribution to the delivery of   the SDGs.
How we contribute to goals 7, 8 and 13  Through our business activities Œ delivering energy products and services to the world Œ   we contribute directly to goals 7, 8 and 13.

13Sustainability at BP Key sustainability issues To make sure we report about the sustainability issues that matter most to our  stakeholders, we carry out an annual materiality assessment.
We use what we   learn to focus our sustainability reporting on these key issues.
Our materiality methodology In 2019 we worked with an external agency to   refresh and expand our materiality assessment.
We engaged with internal and external   stakeholders, asking them to list and prioritize   their most significant sustainability or ESG   issues.
We also asked them to assess the   relative impact of these issues on our business   and to tell us how in˚uential they think BP can   be in creating positive change.
As a result, we identified 33 key topics and   issues that are important to our business and   stakeholders, and their significance relative to   each other.
We used the results to prioritize our   sustainability reporting for 2019 and we plan to   build on this in 2020.
Our materiality assessment process  Step 1 Setting the parameters We determined the materiality of BP™s key issues using three  parameters: importance, impact and in˚uence.
Each  parameter included clearly defined criteria to enhance the  rigour and robustness of the process and to eliminate  subjectivity as much as possible.
Ł Importance:  the importance of each issue to key internal   and external stakeholders.
Ł  Impact:  the impact of each issue on BP™s future business.
Ł Infiuence:  BP™s ability to in˚uence and drive change  regarding each issue.
We collaborated closely with our risk team at this stage of the  assessment to define the impact criteria and thresholds, as  well as throughout the entire process, to ensure alignment.
Step 2  Identifying issues We carried out a horizon- scanning exercise to identify   a list of issues for stakeholders   to consider and rank.
We  reviewed and considered:  relevant ESG frameworks and  standards (including Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI), SASB   and TCFD); current relevant  legislation; global, market   and industry-specific trends;   existing BP processes, policies  and documentation, including  BP™s risk processes; topics  discussed in the media and   across our industry.
Step 3  Determining the importance   of key issues Using our prioritization criteria, we   conducted interviews and facilitated  an online survey with key external  stakeholders and BP employees to  gather their perspectives on the  importance of BP™s key issues.
Participants came from: investor  companies, academia, NGOs, industry   associations, government, BP  partners and service providers.
In  addition, we used several internal  consumer research documents to  gauge the sustainability priorities of  our customers and consumers.
Step 4 Determining the impact and infiuence  of key issues We ran a survey to gather feedback from senior  employees across BP on the impact and  in˚uence of each issue, using our prioritization  criteria.
To ensure a balanced and representative  viewpoint, we engaged with individuals working  across many different geographies and in  various functions.
Again, our risk team was  closely involved.
Step 5 Analyzing and validating  We used qualitative analysis to extract the key   themes before consolidating them to create a  list of our top ten material issues.
We tested and  validated the final results with a working group  from across BP, including experts in human  rights, social performance and environment,  risk and measurement.
Step 6 Ongoing engagement The process of engaging doesn™t  stop with our materiality research.
We continue to gather feedback  from our stakeholders and will use  this to inform our next materiality  assessment.

15Sustainability at BP We™re growing our low carbon and  renewables businesses, investing  in low carbon activities with potential   to support the energy transition.
Climate change and  the energy transition Why it matters The world is not on a sustainable path and needs  a rapid transition to lower carbon energy in   order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.
What we want to do This will involve meeting growing demand with   energy that is cleaner, as well as reliable and   affordable.
Our approach To advance a low carbon future by working   across the whole of BP.
This includes our   reduce, improve, create, framework.
Performance Ł Zero net growth in operational emissions Ł Established more than 30 carbon neutral   BP retail sites Ł >$500 million invested in low carbon activities What™s next Ł Working to deliver our new ambition to   become a net zero company by 2050 or   sooner, and to help the world get to net zero In this section Our role in the energy transition 18Our ‚reduce, improve, create™ framework 20Accrediting our lower carbon activities 22Reducing emissions in our operations 23Improving our products 26Creating low carbon businesses 3016Energy with purpose means  helping the world get to  net zero 17Introduction Sustainability at BP Our focus areas Doing business  responsibly  Governance Our reporting          1255 34 CO 2 Refining, manufacturing and marketing   Delivering products and  services Findin g and generating energy  Ne t zer o operational emissions.

To meet the goals of the 2015 Paris   Agreement * we believe society must take decisive and collective action.
Our role in this  transition is to provide reliable, affordable and cleaner energy for people and our planet.
Our net zero ambition  Our new ambition is to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner and to help the world get to net zero.
We have set out 10 aims, which together set out a path that is consistent with the Paris goals.
Read about our five aims to help the world get to net zero on  page 5 .
*   Paris Agreement  (1) Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement states the goal of ﬁHolding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the  temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.ﬂ  (2) Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as  possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a  balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable  development and efforts to eradicate poverty.
Net zero  When we talk about helping the world get to net zero we mean achieving a balance between sources of anthropogenic emissions and removal by sinks of  greenhouse gases, as set out in Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement *.
When talking about BP becoming a net zero company by 2050, or sooner, in the context of  our new ambition and aims  1 and  2, this means achieving a balance between (a) the relevant Scope 1 and 2 emissions associated with our operations (aim  1),  or Scope 3 emissions associated with carbon in BP™s net production of oil and gas excluding Rosneft (aim  2), and (b) the total of applicable deductions from  activities such as sinks, for example land carbon projects, which we allow for in our methodology.
Net zero aims  We have set out five aims to get BP to net zero: 1 Net zero operations  Œ net  zero across our entire  operations on an absolute   basis by 2050 or sooner.
2 Net zero oil and gas  Œ net  zero on an absolute  basis across the carbon  in  our upstream oil and  gas  production by 2050  or sooner.
3 Halving intensity Œ cut the  carbon intensity of the   products we sell by 50%  by  2050 or  sooner.
4 Reducing methane Œ install  methane measurement at   all existing major oil and  gas processing sites by  2023, publish the data,  and then drive a 50%  reduction in  the methane  intensity of our operations.
5 More investment for new  energies Œ increase the  proportion of investment  we make into our non-oil  and gas businesses.
18Calling for more progressive climate policies  We plan to allocate more resources to advocate   for well-designed policies, including carbon   pricing.
We believe this is the most efficient   way to reduce GHG emissions and incentivize   everyone, including energy producers and   consumers, to play their part.
In our view,   pricing can be effective either as a tax or as   a cap-and-trade system.
A fifth of the world™s GHG emissions are now  covered by carbon pricing systems.
Stable and   well-designed carbon pricing adds a cost to   energy production and energy products, but it   also provides a basis for future investment and   a level playing field for all energy sources.
We believe that a well-designed price on  carbon should:  Ł Apply to all quantifiable GHG emissions   in all sectors of the economy on a CO 2 equivalent basis.
Ł Pre-empt future and replace existing   regulations that overlap or duplicate the   carbon price.
Ł Prevent the shifting of emissions and jobs   from one country or jurisdiction to another   to avoid carbon taxation.
We recognize that carbon pricing may not   always be the best solution and that in some   cases a range of policy instruments may be   required to address gaps in pricing coverage   or market failures.
Carbon pricing in Washington  State, US We support well-designed carbon pricing  but we™re prepared to oppose poorly  designed proposals.
For example, we opposed the ballot initiative  to introduce a carbon fee in Washington  State, US, in November 2018.
We believed  that the policy was badly designed and  would have harmed Washington™s economy  without significantly reducing carbon   emissions.
The initiative was not passed.
We worked with legislative leaders in the  state in 2019 and 2020 and supported a  cap-and-invest bill, which we believed  would be more effective.
We intend to work  with the Washington legislature during its  2021 session to see if a new carbon bill can  be advanced.
Leading in transparency In February 2020, we announced our aim   to be recognized as an industry leader for the   transparency of our reporting.
This means   providing our stakeholders with the information   they require, particularly in relation to our low   carbon strategy and aims.
At the 2019 BP AGM, the board recommended  that shareholders support a special resolution   requisitioned by Climate Action 100+ on climate   change disclosures.
More than 99% of   shareholders voted for this resolution, which   requires BP to respond to a number of different   elements.
Read more in the  BP Annual Report 2019   on page 6.
Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures We support the recommendations of the  Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD), which was established  by the Financial Stability Board with the aim  of improving the reporting of climate-related  risks and opportunities.
We intend to work  constructively with the TCFD and others to  develop good practices and standards for   transparency.
This will be a multi-year  journey, but we have already started and   our latest reporting provides information   supporting the recommended disclosures.
Read more in the  BP Annual Report 2019  on page 42 and at  bp.com/annualreport.
Mobilizing and motivating our employees We™re unlocking human energy across BP in   response to the energy transition.
Our Advancing Low Carbon accreditation  programme made 76 accreditations in 2019.
In the UK, employees also responded positively   to the ‚My Advancing Low Carbon™ programme   launched in 2019, through which they can offset   their carbon emissions from personal travel and   home energy use.
Read more about our Advancing Low Carbon  programme on  page 22 .We™ve also received more than 100 submissions   through our $100-million Upstream carbon fund   since its launch, and 124 entries in the low   carbon category of our BP Helios awards.
In 2018 we announced plans to link our annual  cash bonus to our sustainable emissions   reduction (SER) target.
This means around   37,000 eligible employees, including executives,   are now incentivized and rewarded for their   contribution to reducing carbon emissions in BP.
In February 2020 we announced our aim to  incentivize our global workforce to deliver on   our new aims and become advocates for net   zero.
This will include increasing the percentage   of remuneration linked to SERs.
Working with others  We™re working with other businesses, governments   and civil society, to support the expansion of   carbon pricing through our participation in the   Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition and the   US-based Climate Leadership Council.
In 2019   we engaged with policymakers in Europe,   Australia, Canada and China.
Natural climate solutions Natural climate solutions (NCS) are changes in   land use and management that can reduce net   GHG emissions and increase the absorption of   CO2 already in the atmosphere through the  creation and expansion of ‚natural sinks™.
NCS  can be delivered by restoring and changing the  management or use of a wide range of habitats,  including wetlands, forests, grasslands and  agricultural or coastal areas.
We strongly support NCS as a key part of the  energy transition and a necessary component  of meeting the Paris goals and achieving net  zero emissions.
It™s estimated that NCS could  deliver around one third of the total GHG  emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris  goals by 2030, at a reasonable cost.
They can  also support biodiversity, contribute to  improvements in water quality and quantity,  and help provide sustainable livelihoods for  local communities.
We™re undertaking various policy and  commercial activities to accelerate the scale-up  of NCS, including advocating for its wider use  on a voluntary or regulatory basis and enabling  investment for NCS trading.
We™re supporting  or participating in several multi-stakeholder  initiatives and partnerships, involving academia,  businesses, NGOs, multilateral agencies and  some governments, to foster a shared vision  for NCS and principles to help ensure that NCS  deliver measurable emissions reductions,  with appropriate environmental and social  safeguards.
These initiatives include the NCS  Alliance, led by the World Business Council for  Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and World  Economic Forum (WEF).

Our ‚reduce, improve, create™  framework Our commitment to advance a low  carbon future is underpinned and   informed by our ‚reduce, improve,   create™ (RIC) framework.
This focuses   on reducing greenhouse gas   emissions in our own operations,   improving our products to help our   customers lower their emissions,   and creating low carbon businesses   that support the energy transition.
Our low carbon journey has gathered pace  since we set targets in 2018 to help frame our   commitment to advancing the energy transition.
In 2019 we made 1.4 MteCO 2e of sustainable  emissions reductions a (SERs) Œ re˚ecting  continued engagement and activity across   the group since the targets were launched.
We delivered over 100 separate sustainable   emission reduction activities in 2019.
In 2020 we plan to provide an update on the  next phase of our framework.
See  bp.com/targets .a   SERs result from BP actions or interventions that have led  to ongoing reductions in Scope 1 (direct) and/or Scope 2  (indirect) GHG emissions (carbon dioxide and methane)  such that GHG emissions would have been higher in the  reporting year if the intervention had not taken place.
SERs   must meet three criteria: BP made a specific intervention  that has reduced GHG emissions, BP must be able to  quantify the reduction and the reduction is expected to be   ongoing.
Reductions are reportable for a 12-month period  from the start of the intervention/action.
b In accordance with our zero net growth methodology, the  starting GHG baseline (end of 2015) is adjusted at the end  of each reporting year for any qualifying changes (this  covers changes due to acquisitions, divestments, outsourcing  or insourcing where the total for the year is greater than   5% of overall emissions from the previous year or is due  to methodology or protocol changes).

Our accreditation programme for lower carbon activities.
See  page 22 .
21a  The total emissions saved or offset from the accredited  activities are estimated using a variety of methodologies  and baselines.
The figures aim only to illustrate the impact  of the activities within the programme; and delivered by   BP or a BP partner only refers to the organization leading   on delivering the activity.
Savings or offsets may be claimed   by or attributed to other parties.
The scope of accredited  activities is wider than, and does not seek to align with, our   GHG reporting boundaries.
Therefore, the figures are not  directly comparable to BP™s reported emissions.
Delivering a better carbon outcome  To gain accreditation by BP, each activity must   meet certain criteria Œ including delivering a   ‚better carbon outcome™.
This can be done by: Ł reducing GHG emissions Ł producing less carbon than competitor   or industry benchmarks Ł providing renewable energy Ł offsetting carbon produced Ł furthering research and technology   to advance low carbon Ł enabling BP or others to reach their   low carbon objectives Teams from across BP™s businesses have taken   part, identifying ways to reduce carbon in our   operations, products and technologies, and   finding ways to measure the impact.
The   programme aims to inspire our people and   partners to advance low carbon.
By recognizing   the many ways in which we are advancing low   carbon, we hope to find more opportunities to   scale these activities and help the world to reach   net zero.
For a full list of accredited activities and  Deloitte™s assurance statement go to  bp.com/advancinglowcarbon .
Accrediting our lower  carbon activities Our Advancing Low Carbon (ALC)  accreditation programme aims to   inspire every part of BP to identify   lower carbon opportunities to   support our net zero ambition.
Since its launch in 2017, the programme has  motivated people across BP to help advance   low carbon, with 76 accreditations of 2019   activities Œ up from 52 in 2018.
Each activity   supports our ambition by reducing emissions   in our operations, improving our products, or   creating low carbon businesses.
These activities take place through our own  businesses, as well as in partnership with others.
Deloitte conducts independent assurance on ALC   activities, including: assessing the application   of our process and criteria for accrediting   activities, and confirming greenhouse gas   (GHG) emissions that are offset and saved   through the programme.
We estimate that 64MteCO 2e have been saved  or offset through activities delivered by BP, and  5.4Mte through activities delivered by BP  partners, since the programme began in 2017. aEnergy with purpose Engaging BP employees in  advancing low carbon As part of our My Advancing Low Carbon programme  (My ALC), BP employees in the UK and the US can  offset their carbon emissions from personal travel  and home energy use.
Employees can choose the carbon emissions  profile that best matches their lifestyle and BP  Target Neutral provides offsets for their carbon  footprint.
The programme supports high-quality  carbon credits from a range of carefully selected   projects on a not-for-profit basis.
Each project  helps to reduce carbon emissions while contributing  to improving the lives of millions of people.
Since the programme was launched at the end of  2019, BP employees in the UK and US have chosen  to offset the equivalent of 31,800 ˚ights between  London Heathrow and Houston, or the removal of  6,900 passenger cars from the roads for a year.
The more employees who enrol, the greater the  low carbon benefit and as BP pays 50% of the cost  to encourage this, making a difference costs less  per month than a cup of coffee.

standard practice to identify lower carbon  options at the earliest project stage, when there   is the greatest opportunity to reduce operational   emissions and optimize project design in line   with our central case internal carbon price of   $40 per tonne (2015 $ real).
In 2019 we exceeded our target of 3.5Mte of  SERs for the period 2016 to 2025, six years   ahead of schedule.
We reported 1.4MteCO 2 of  reductions and a total of 3.9MteCO 2 since 2016.
Ł In Angola we delivered further reductions   in ˚aring emissions in 2019 by building on   process optimizations that started in 2018   and implementing well management   strategies.
Ł In Oman, we invested in performance   improvements to our power generators,   which allowed us to operate with a reduced   number of gas turbines.
We also successfully   applied working practices and technologies for   well tests and green completions in Khazzan.
Ł At our BP Whiting refinery in the US, the   installation of a new control scheme on a   ˚are system has reduced continuous natural   gas purging.
Ł Our onshore BPX Energy sites executed   various projects to reduce methane venting   from equipment and fugitive emissions, with   the additional implementation of compressor   optimization initiatives, which reduced fuel   consumption on site.
Reducing emissions   in our operations In 2019 we made further progress  against the three operational   emissions targets we set in 2018.
These targets were to deliver: zero   net growth in operational emissions   out to 2025 against an adjusted   2015 baseline a; 3.5Mte of  sustainable greenhouse gas   emission reductions (SERs) for the   period 2016 to 2025; and a methane   intensity of 0.2%.
Our target of zero net growth in operational  emissions out to 2025 aims to ensure that our   carbon footprint does not grow as our business   grows.
We will offset any increase in our GHG   emissions above a 2015 baseline that cannot be   managed through reductions, including SERs.
In 2019 we did not need to purchase offsets in   line with this target.
Looking forward, 11 major upstream projects   are scheduled for delivery by the end of 2021.
For all BP-operated major projects, it™s now  Ł Our shipping operations delivered emissions   reductions in 2019 through improved   efficiency of the new oil and LNG vessels   delivered in 2018 and 2019.

Our greenhouse gas emissions in 2019  Despite significant sustainable emissions   reductions (SERs), our overall 2019 GHG   emissions increased due mainly to major   acquisitions.
We achieved zero net growth   in our operational emissions with no offsets   required against our adjusted 2015 baseline a.Operational control  Scope 1 (direct) emissions from sites   operated by BP increased by 0.4MteCO 2e to  49.2MteCO 2e in 2019, from 48.8MteCO 2e  in 2018.
Emissions increases due to major   acquisitions were largely balanced out by SERs   of 1.4MteCO 2e delivered in 2019.
Scope 2  (indirect) emissions decreased by 0.2MteCO 2e (3%) compared to 2018.
In our upstream businesses, emissions  increased by 0.2MteCO 2e (less than 1%),  but we delivered sustainable emission   reductions of 1.26MteCO 2e in 2019.
Flaring  We achieved a decrease in upstream ˚aring   Œthe controlled burning of gas during gas and  oil production Œ for the second year running,  as a result of emissions reduction activity.
Flaring fell by 13% from 1.6Mte in 2018 to  1.4Mte in 2019.
Angola operations were the  largest single contributor to ˚aring reductions.
Equity share emissions  Our Scope 1 (direct) equity share emissions   decreased by 0.5MteCO 2e to 46.0MteCO 2e in  2019 (2018 46.5MteCO 2e).
Emissions resulting  from the BHP acquisitions were balanced out   by sustainable emissions reductions and the   impact of divestments.
Our Scope 2 (indirect)   emissions remained the same in 2019 at   5.7MteCO 2e compared with 2018.
Net zero aims   Aim 1: net zero operations  We aim to be net zero across our entire operations   on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner.
This aim   relates to Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions.
Aim 2: net zero oil and gas We aim to be net zero on an absolute basis   across the carbon in our upstream oil and gas   production by 2050 or sooner.
This is our   Scope 3 aim, and is on a BP equity share basis   excluding Rosneft.
The carbon was equivalent   to around 360Mte of emissions in 2019 b.Aim 3: halving intensity  Our aim is to cut the carbon intensity of the   products we sell by 50%, by 2050 or sooner.
This is a lifecycle carbon intensity approach,   per unit of energy.
It covers marketing sales   of energy products c and, potentially, in future,  certain other products, such as those   associated with land carbon projects.
Scope 3 There are 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions.
For our industry the most important of these   categories is the ‚use of sold products™   (category 11).
For this category of Scope 3,   we are reporting for the first time the   estimated CO 2 emissions from the carbon in  our upstream oil and gas production.
This   metric replaces the ‚customer emissions™   metric, which we reported in our previous   Sustainability Report because it better   aligns with our new aim to be net zero   across the carbon in our upstream oil and   gas production.
Going forward, we believe   this metric will allow us to monitor and   report progress against this aim.
Estimated emissions intensity dCarbon intensity (gCO 2e/MJ) Average emissions intensity of marketed energy products 79.7 Refined energy products 93.7 Gas products 71.6 Bioproducts 28.8 Power products 43.8 GHG emissions 24a Methane intensity refers to the amount of methane emissions from BP™s operated upstream oil and gas assets as a percentage of the total gas that goes to market from those operations.
Our methodology is aligned with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative™s (OGCI).
Reducing methane emissions We™re taking action to reduce the amount of   methane that enters the atmosphere from our   oil and gas operations.
Methane is the primary   component of natural gas and although it has   a shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than CO 2, it has higher global warming potential.
We target   a methane intensity a of 0.2%.
Aim 4: reducing methane  Our aim is to install methane measurement   at all our existing major oil and gas processing   sites by 2023, publish the data, and then drive   a 50% reduction in methane intensity of   our operations.
And we will work to in˚uence   our joint ventures to set their own methane   intensity targets of 0.2%.
This new aim isn™t intended to defer actions to  help us reduce our methane intensity by 50%   until after 2023.
We want to make sure that the   quantification of progress towards the reduction   is informed by methane measurement at our   major oil and gas processing sites.
So we™re   keeping up the momentum to tackle methane   and working on ways to use measurement to   take account of Œ and report Œ verified reductions   achieved before our programme of installing   measurement is complete.
Throughout 2019, we continued working to  reduce our operational methane emissions Œ   from upgrades in mature production fields to   the design of new technology.
For example,   in our US onshore business we have begun using   solar instead of gas pneumatic pumps.
Working with others We continue to work with key stakeholders   on activities designed to improve detection,   measurement, quantification, verification and   reporting of methane emissions.
We™re taking   a leadership role in addressing the methane   challenge through the improvements we™ve   made to our own operations, but also through   collaboration with our peers, NGOs, third-party  experts and academic research institutions.
For example, we are part of the Collaboratory   to Advance Methane Science, an industry-led   group helping the oil and gas sector find the most   effective strategies for cutting methane emissions.
We™re also working with the Environmental  Defense Fund (EDF) and together with them   in 2019 we announced a three-year strategic   commitment to advance technologies and   practices to reduce methane emissions from   the global oil and gas industry.
The agreement   will enable collaboration on projects that test   technologies and emerging strategies to   continue improving methane management.
Our methane performance in 2019 Our methane intensity in 2019 was 0.14%,   an improvement from 0.16% in 2018.
We   previously reported this number to one decimal   place but are now reporting it to two, in order   to better demonstrate year-on-year changes.
Since 2016 our methane intensity has   decreased by 44% from 0.25%.
In 2019 methane emissions from upstream  operations, used to calculate our intensity,   increased by 3% (4,808mmscf in 2019 from   4,674mmscf in 2018) with the assets acquired   over the past 18 months being countered by   SERs including ˚aring decreases and leak   detection and repair.
Marketed gas increased   by 14% (3,370,404mmscf in 2019 from   2,952,071mmscf) with marketed gas volumes   increasing in BPX, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.
0.2020182019 0.140.16Methane intensity(%)Using technology to improve methane data  For several years, we™ve used hand-held infrared   cameras to detect small leaks of fugitive   emissions.
New technology now makes it   possible to quantify the emissions these cameras   detect so we can prioritize repairs.
Following a   pilot of this technology in Azerbaijan and the US   in 2018, we™ve now deployed the technology   more widely and also appointed a number of   employees as ‚super users™ to share the skills   needed to use it.
These employees will provide   information about how to make the technology   more user friendly and embed the data collected   into our existing data management systems.
We™re using advanced imaging cameras that  can continuously monitor facilities and identify   leaks earlier than routine inspections.
These   cameras connect directly to our control rooms   and send automated alerts.
They™re now in use   at our Khazzan gas field in Oman and are set   to be installed in Trinidad and Tobago in 2020.
They™ve also been prioritized for Sangachal and   Khazzan Phase 2 in the future.
We™re planning   for all new major projects to use real time   methane detection (if methane is or has potential   to be a material emission source).
Our US onshore gas business is deploying  drone-mounted sensors to inspect equipment.
These drones are more efficient than hand-held   devices and safer than human interventions.
They also cut the carbon cost associated with   inspection vehicles.
Together with the Oil and   Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), we™re exploring   the potential of satellite technology to measure   GHG emissions from our facilities.
Energy with purpose Reducing methane emissions in Angola The BP Angola team operating the offshore  Greater Plutonio project achieved sustainable  emissions reductions of 1.5 MteCO 2 over a 12  month period 2018-2019, while also increasing   production by 14mboed during the same period.
The team set out with a simple objective Œ to reduce  GHG emissions and not waste energy.
They explored  ways to reduce ˚aring using a tool called APEX,  which enabled them to create simulated duplications  of the entire operational network.
They explored possible improvement measures by  simulating a range of operational scenarios, then  tested these in live field trials.
The team say they   were genuinely astonished by the success of this  process, which highlighted the ‚sweet spot™ in  terms of their compression and separation systems.
The reduction in ˚aring was immediate and visible  to the human eye, with gas being sent down to the  Angola liquid natural gas plant onshore, rather  than wasted.
Not only did BP Angola achieve CO 2 reductions and efficiency improvements, it was   also recognized as the winner in the Advancing  Low Carbon category of the 2019 BP Helios awards.
25Our focus areas At our Pangbourne technology  hub we conduct research and  development of fuels and lubricants.
Improving our products We can improve the carbon  credentials of our products for   customers by: providing lower   emission gas for power generation;   developing more efficient and   lower carbon fuels, lubricants and   petrochemicals; and growing low   carbon offers to help these   customers reduce their carbon   emissions.
Lower emission gas for power generation As the world moves towards net zero emissions,   we think natural gas can play an important role   in getting us there.
When burned for power,   natural gas has, on average on a lifecycle basis,   about half the GHG emissions of coal, with   fewer air pollutants, so expanding its use   globally to displace coal will help to reduce   carbon emissions.
In fact, switching from coal to   gas has avoided more than 500MteCO 2 from  the power sector globally since 2010.
As the   amount of renewables in the energy mix grows,   gas can also be a ˚exible partner to wind and   solar, providing a reliable back-up source that™s   not weather dependent.
Natural gas is adaptable, suitable for use in both  domestic and industrial applications, and now   widely available via a growing global market that   uses pipelines and marine tankers.
Looking   ahead, gas can also be decarbonized.
By using   carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS)   technology, the CO 2 generated when gas is  burned for power or heat in industry can be   captured so that it doesn™t reach the air.
It can   then be stored, or used, for example, to create   building materials.
We aim to be a leader in tackling methane  emissions to help maximize the climate benefits   of gas.
This means reducing ˚aring and venting,   and working to minimize methane leaks.
We were   one of the first energy companies to set a   methane intensity target which is set at 0.2%.
Read more about how we™re reducing methane  from natural gas on  page 25 .Lower carbon fuels, lubricants   and petrochemicals  We™re pursuing several different routes to lower   the carbon footprint of our fuels, lubricants and   petrochemicals.
They include: Ł Decarbonizing our products:  we are  co-processing biogenic feedstocks with   conventional diesel at a number of our   refineries.
During 2019 we continued to scale   up co-processing, growing the volume of   lower carbon bio-feedstock processed.
We are piloting a growing range of bio  lubricants and continue to develop new   technologies in this area.
Through our investment, we™re helping  commercialize Fulcrum technology that converts   household rubbish, which would otherwise be   sent to landfill, into fuel for transport.
Ł Efficient manufacturing:  BP™s PTAir  branded PTA is one of the building blocks in   everyday polyester clothing and packaging   items.
It has a carbon footprint almost 30%   below the European average.
Ł Promoting circularity:  we increasingly think  about resource intensity alongside the carbon   intensity of our products, and try to promote   circularity where we can.
Ł Helping customers reduce their emissions:  we offer high performance fuels and   lubricants Œ including BP Ultimate fuels with   ACTIVE technology Œ that are designed to   promote efficient engine performance and   fuel economy, to help reduce emissions.
Ł Carbon neutral products and services:  through BP Target Neutral, we™ve expanded   our Castrol carbon offsetting consultancy   service for customers to cover Mexico, China   and India.
This means it™s now offered in   12 countries worldwide.
In 2019 we opened carbon neutral retail sites  in Mexico, Indonesia and China, while Castrol   extended its carbon neutral auto dealership   service into India and China.
This service   gives dealers the tools and support to make   their dealerships carbon neutral and to   service vehicles with carbon neutral   lubricants.
Working with others   At our Pangbourne technology centre in the UK,   BP experts collaborate with car makers and   original equipment manufacturers to co-engineer   advanced lubricants, e-˚uids and special fuels,   while also improving the performance and   efficiency of cars, trucks and transmissions   already in the market.
26Pangbourne acts as a global hub, drawing  research capabilities and expertise from our   other global technology centres and world-  leading universities including the University   of Cambridge, Imperial College London, the   University of Manchester and the University   of Illinois at UrbanaŒChampaign.
Together with these universities, we conduct  studies through our research organization, the   International Centre of Advanced Materials   (ICAM), to test and analyze the requirements of   the future transport sector.
We™re focused on   how we can make transformational breakthroughs.
For example, a project at the University of   Cambridge is exploring future opportunities   with ICAM to support our research into   e-mobility.
Growing low carbon offers for  our customers  For 14 years we™ve helped customers take   action on their emissions through our carbon   reduction and offsetting programme, BP Target   Neutral.
During this time we™ve helped bring   more than 20 carbon neutral products and   services to market for the aviation, commercial,   transport and automotive sectors.
Some of these are world firsts, for example:  carbon neutral Castrol lubricants; helping ˚eet   customers offset emissions though fuel cards;   and carbon neutral PTA.
BP Target Neutral has helped customers  offset over 5 million tonnes of greenhouse   gas emissions since 2006, generating around   $20 million to support carbon offsetting projects   worldwide.
These have contributed to emissions   reductions, helped to improve livelihoods,   financed renewable energy generation, and   protected internationally significant forest land.
>5Mte of greenhouse gas emissions offset by  customers through BP Target Neutral  since 2006 Supporting a new global transport system Supporting the development of a new transport   system is a focus area for us Œ including electric   vehicles and their charging infrastructure Œ   because 25% of emissions currently come   from transport.
We™re modernizing our fuels   and retail business to support the transition.
In 2019 we hosted an event bringing together  leading companies from across the electrification   ecosystem to discuss shared challenges and   opportunities.
We also commissioned and   published an independent report, ‚On the Move™,   to explore expert and consumer opinions on the   future of road transport, focusing on the real   and perceived barriers consumers face in   adopting lower carbon alternatives.
The report   was based on a survey of 12,000 people across   three European countries.
Other modes of transport such as air travel,  heavy transport and marine transport may be   unsuitable for electrification.
For these, we™re   exploring other ways to reduce emissions, including   biofuels, liquefied natural gas and hydrogen.
Investing in hydrogen  Hydrogen has important potential as a   close-to-zero carbon option for power and heat   generation, for transport, and as a source of   lower carbon feedstocks used to make products.
Hydrogen could be an essential complement to   electrification of the global energy systems of   the future.
We™re exploring its potential to   reduce emissions in our operations, improve   our products and provide the basis for creating   low carbon businesses.
In 2019 we joined the Hydrogen Council,  a global CEO-led initiative to promote and   support the role of hydrogen in the energy   transition.
The Council aims to accelerate   investment into large-scale commercialization   of hydrogen solutions across industries   worldwide.
We™re also a member of Hydrogen   Europe, which seeks to promote and develop   large-scale, low carbon hydrogen-based   opportunities.
In our view, robust policies,   including carbon pricing, will be required to   incentivize the investment required to   exponentially grow the use of hydrogen.
We™re exploring the potential of blue hydrogen   Œ hydrogen from natural gas Œ from which the   carbon is captured and stored.
We also believe   green hydrogen produced from the electrolysis   of water using renewable energy will play an   increasingly important role, particularly in parts of   the world with high renewable energy potential.
We use large amounts of hydrogen in our   refinery operations.
This is typically generated   from fossil fuel sources without carbon capture   (grey hydrogen).
We™re actively evaluating a   number of options at some of our refineries to   replace current hydrogen production with green   hydrogen, which will help to lower the carbon   footprint of our refineries and products.
With the anticipated growth in hydrogen  demand, we™re pursuing opportunities to develop   new low carbon businesses in this area.
We now   have a dedicated hydrogen team, which is   progressing opportunities in green ammonia   production and export, and green hydrogen   for transport.
In October 2019 we appointed   our first vice president of green hydrogen.
27Carbon capture, use and storage We believe carbon capture, use and storage   (CCUS) can play a vital role in limiting   emissions Œ helping us to reduce our carbon   footprint and supporting global efforts to   meet the Paris goals.
CCUS can significantly reduce emissions  from gas power generation and energy-  intensive industries that rely on fossil fuels.
Its advantages include: Ł Greater energy diversity, including lower   carbon fossil fuels.
Ł Enabling investment in different energy   sources, including low emission hydrogen   production from natural gas.
Ł Expanding technology choices for   decarbonized, ˚exible and reliable power.
Ł Protecting the value of substantial capital   investments in power, industrial and   manufacturing infrastructure.
Ł Employment and investment opportunities   in industrial centres.
Although CCUS requires significant upfront   investment, over time its deployment at   scale can be expected to bring costs down.
A third party study in the UK found that for   every £1 invested in carbon capture, the pay   back to the national economy is almost £5.
With an average CCUS project currently   capable of capturing at least one million   tonnes of CO 2 every year, the process offers  a cost-effective way to decarbonize,   transition to a lower carbon economy, and   reach the Paris net zero target.
It also creates   opportunities to build new low carbon   businesses, with the CO 2 sold to support  these ventures.
CCUS collaboration  Collaboration is needed to make CCUS   mainstream.
It™s been used for more than   20 years, but needs government support,   such as carbon pricing and policy making, to   accelerate its deployment.
Through the Oil   and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), we™re   identifying the policy mechanisms that could   be most effective in scaling CCUS up on a   regional basis.
In the US, we are also playing   a leadership role in a National Petroleum   Council (NPC) report.
We™re exploring opportunities to deploy  CCUS in our own operations and projects.
For example, we™re participating in a joint   venture in the UAE, which uses CO 2 from  industrial processes to enhance oil recovery.
We™re also playing a leading role in the   OGCI™s Net Zero Teesside project in the UK.
Energy with purpose Testing carbon capture, use and storage  in the UK Net Zero Teesside is an integrated CCUS project  that will store the CO 2 emissions from carbon  intensive industries situated in the Teesside  industrial cluster.
The project aims to decarbonize  a number of carbon-intensive businesses by as  early as 2030 and deliver the UK™s first zero-carbon  industrial cluster.
Teesside industries account for 5.6% of industrial  emissions in the UK and the area is home to five of  the UK™s top 25 CO 2 emitters.
The project is being  developed to store up to 6Mte of carbon dioxide  each year Œ the equivalent to the annual energy  use of over two million homes.
Although details are still being finalized, the  project would comprise both onshore and  offshore elements, potentially: Ł A high efficiency gas-fired power station,   including carbon capture plant, that can deliver  low carbon gas power locally and nationally.
Ł CO2 pipeline infrastructure connecting the  power plant and nearby heavy industrial   facilities.
Industries capturing CO 2 from their  own processes would have access to this   network so that their CO 2 can be transported  and stored.
Ł A pipeline for the onward transport of CO 2 to the  offshore storage site.
Ł Offshore, a geologically secure site deep under  the North Sea where the CO 2 will be  permanently stored.
This will be either a saline  aquifer or a depleted oil or gas field.
Sites in the  southern North Sea have around 1,000Mte of  available storage capacity, enough for many  decades of storage.
The project is owned by OGCI Climate Investments   as a non-operating shareholder and is being  developed on its behalf by five OGCI member  companies.
As the project progresses, government funding  and supportive policy will be crucial to making   the project economically viable.
The project won   £3.8 million in funding as part of the Department  for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy™s call   for CCUS Innovation Programme in 2019 and is  expected to continue to be funded by the  consortium of five OGCI member companies.
28 Supporting a circular economy The world needs to use scarce resources  in radically new ways; moving from a ‚take,   make, waste™ approach towards one in which   materials are re-used, recycled, repurposed   and redirected to extend their purposeful life   for as long as possible.
BP can contribute to   this through the way we use resources in our   businesses and by shifting our mindset to   design and operate with circularity in mind.
We could see waste first and foremost as   a possible feedstock for other processes.
This is already happening in some parts of  our operations.
For example, Downstream   is working with Virent and Johnson Matthey   to advance a bioforming process for the   production of bio-paraxylene, a key raw   material for renewable plastics.
Circular thinking is in its early stages across  all industries, but we will continue to explore   new ways to support it.
Energy with purpose Joining forces to tackle plastic waste Leading companies Œ from food, drink and  consumer goods giants to waste management,  packaging and recycling specialists Œ have joined  forces with BP in a new consortium to help tackle  plastic waste by accelerating the commercialization  of BP Infinia enhanced recycling technology.
BP, Britvic, Danone, Unilever, ALPLA and  REMONDIS have combined their capability and  experience to develop a new circular approach to   dealing with polyethylene terephthalate (PET)  plastic waste.
In particular, they will work to speed  up bringing the recycling technology to market in  order to target the difficult-to-recycle plastic food  trays and coloured bottles that are currently  thrown away.
BP Infinia is an enhanced recycling technology  designed to turn opaque and difficult-to-recycle  PET plastic waste into recycled feedstocks that  can be used to make new, high-quality PET plastic  packaging again and again, with no loss in quality.
The aim is to create an even stronger circular PET   economy where all items and applications in future  can be recycled back into their original purpose.
We plan to build a $25 million pilot plant in the US  to prove the technology on a continuous basis,  which we have targeted to be operational around  the end of 2020.
29Lightsource BP entered the Spanish  solar market and established a  presence in Brazil in 2019.
Creating low carbon  businesses We™re growing our low carbon and  renewables businesses, investing in   low carbon activities with potential   to support the energy transition,   and working with others, for   example, through the Oil and Gas   Climate Initiative (OGCI) $1 billion   fund for research and technology.
Growing our low carbon and  renewables businesses  BP has been in renewables for more than   20 years.
We™ve played a part in the sector™s   transformation from its early promise to becoming   the fastest-growing energy source in the world.
Our experience has taught us many vital lessons,  including how to prove technologies and   processes, then roll them out at commercial scale.
We™ve also learnt the value of complementary   partnerships, for example through a 50:50 venture   in the solar business Lightsource BP.
By combining   Lightsource™s solar development experience   and track record with BP™s global scale, reach   and relationships, we aim to create real change   on the energy landscape.
Investing in low carbon activities  We™re currently investing at least $500 million   a year to support low carbon activities, including   our renewables businesses and acquisitions.
Around $200 million of this investment is used   to develop options for lower carbon businesses   in five areas: advanced mobility, bio and low   carbon products, carbon management, digital   transformation, and storage.
Efficient financing We™re looking at the efficient financing  models that are emerging in the evolving  renewable energy sector and that play a role  in creating value in this sector.
Renewable  power projects can be highly attractive  investments for certain types of investors,  particularly when underpinned by long-term  power purchase agreements.
Finance can be   raised against the assets, alongside equity  investment, and allows greater scale to be  realized.
Lightsource BP is an example of this and has  a very successful track record of raising  funding to support its growth and expansion.
The BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture was  also able to obtain finance secured against   its assets, again enabling BP to grow its  participation in biofuels and biopower with  limited further BP investment.
Read more about Lightsource BP on   page 32 .Biofuels  Using biofuels at increasing scale can help to  reduce emissions in the global transport system.
In our biofuels business, we produce ethanol   from sugarcane in Brazil, which has life cycle   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions around 70%   lower than conventional transport fuels.
In 2019 we made a step up in scale and in  ambition through a 50:50 joint venture with Bunge   to create a leading bioenergy company in Brazil,   one of the world™s largest and fast-growing   markets for biofuels and biopower.
BP Bunge Bioenergia brings together two  businesses with complementary assets   and experiences.
It creates a highly efficient   producer of ethanol and low carbon biopower   and has grown our existing biofuels business   by more than 50%.
The joint venture is now   capable of producing around 2.3 billion litres   of ethanol equivalent a year.
In 2019, BP™s three   former sites produced 796 million litres of   ethanol equivalent.
In order to better connect our ethanol production  with the country™s main fuel markets, we operate   a joint venture with Copersucar, one of the   world™s leading ethanol and sugar traders.
This includes operating a major ethanol storage   terminal in Brazil™s main fuels distribution hub.
30Energy with purpose Building our bioenergy capability BP Bunge Bioenergia operates in Brazil, the world™s  second largest and most integrated market for  ethanol as a transport fuel.
Around 75% of all road  vehicles in the country are able to run on ethanol.
In 2019 ethanol demand increased by 10%  compared with 2018 and is set to increase by up to  55% by 2030.
The joint venture operates 11 biofuel sites in  Brazil, of which eight were previously operated by   Bunge and three by BP.
These sites provide annual  crushing capacity of 32 million metric tonnes and BP Bunge Bioenergia is ranked as the second  largest player in the sugarcane ethanol biofuel  industry in Brazil based on its effective crushing  capacity.
It has the ˚exibility to produce a mix of  ethanol and sugar.
In addition to its core operation, BP Bunge  Bioenergia generates enough renewable energy,  fuelled by biomass from the sugarcane it uses, to  power all its sites and sell surplus electricity to the   Brazilian power grid.
31In our 2019 Energy Outlook ‚rapid  transition™ scenario, renewables  account for around 30% of primary   energy by 2040.
In November 2019 Lightsource BP became the  first company in the UK to provide a reactive   power service from a solar plant at night.
The power was delivered through UK Power   Networks™ distribution network and has the   potential to help National Grid™s Electricity   System Operator (ESO) manage voltage on the   UK transmission network.
The trial follows three   years of testing and development through the   ‚Power Potential™ project run by UK Power   Networks and ESO.
This project has the   potential to save UK energy customers over   £400 million by 2050 and provide up to an   additional 4GW of power capacity.
Lightsource BP believes the use of bi-facial  solar panels will boost the amount of solar   energy generated at its solar farms.
Tests have   shown that these panels can increase electricity   output by almost 15%, but this can be much   higher if the ground beneath the panel is as   re˚ective as possible.
Lightsource BP is now   working with a grass seed company in Norfolk   to find the ‚most re˚ective™ grass type to grow   underneath its bi-facial panels in the UK.
Wind energy We have significant interests in onshore wind   energy in the US, where we operate nine sites   in six states and hold an interest in another   facility in Hawaii.
Together they have net   generating capacity of 926MW.
In 2017 we started work with ONYX InSight, a  JV between BP Castrol and Romax Technology,   to develop monitoring techniques that allow us   to predict maintenance needs across many   BP-operated sites.
The ability to identify   potential turbine failures this provides, is   reducing our maintenance costs by up to 30%   and helping us manage the long-term integrity   of our assets.
Biopower  BP Bunge Bioenergia creates biopower from   bagasse, the fibre that remains after crushing   sugarcane stalks.
It produces enough renewable   energy to power all of the joint venture (JV)   sites, with the remainder being exported to   the national grid in Brazil.
The JV is capable of   exporting 1,200 gigawatt hours of electricity a   year.
Biopower is a low carbon power source,   with part of the CO 2 emitted from burning  bagasse offset by the CO 2 absorbed by  sugarcane during its growth.
Solar energy In the ‚evolving transition™ scenario included in   the  BP Energy Outlook 2019 , solar could  generate 11% of total global power by 2040 and   this could grow to more than 20% in our ‚rapid   transition™ scenario.
In December 2019 we increased our investment  in Lightsource BP, creating a 50:50 joint   venture.
In 2018 Lightsource BP doubled the   number of countries where it operated from five   to ten.
It is now active in 13 countries and has   achieved high growth in Spain, the US, Brazil and   Australia.
Typically, Lightsource BP operates through  corporate power purchase agreements.
For   example, in the US, it worked together with   local Colorado-based utility Xcel Energy to   develop a 240MW solar facility to power an   EVRAZ steel mill in Pueblo via a corporate   power purchase agreement.
EVRAZ has stated   that the solar facility will make it an industry   leader in lowering its carbon footprint during   steel production.
We™ve installed aerodynamic enhancements   on various turbines across our wind business.
The technologies are designed to increase   the amount of energy captured from the   wind and have helped increase overall annual   energy production per unit by between 1-2%.
We™re also using drones to complete detailed   and one-off integrity management inspections   of blades.
Drones allow us to take high-resolution   images of any blade damage and then schedule   the appropriate repairs and maintenance.
Their use also reduces risk by eliminating the   need for people to access the blade directly.
Renewable products Butamax ®, our 50:50 JV with DuPont, has  developed technology that converts sugars   from corn into bio-isobutanol Œ an energy-rich   bioproduct that has a variety of applications,   for example in making paints, coatings and   lubricant components.
It™s a lower carbon   alternative to isobutanol and can be blended   with gasoline at higher concentrations than   ethanol.
We™re exploring market opportunities   for the product.
Alternative Energy developments Our Alternative Energy low carbon power unit   is looking at opportunities to create value at the   interplay between gas and renewable energy.
Technology has the potential to revolutionize   ‚emerging value chains™ and we™re developing   a number of digital platforms to connect   consumers with local, low carbon electricity   to power their homes and transport.
1st Lightsource BP became the first  company in the UK to provide a   reactive power source from a solar   plant at night 32Energy with purpose Investing in digital energy solutions BP is expanding its digital energy portfolio by  investing in an exciting energy management  company called Grid Edge.
The technology uses artificial intelligence to help  businesses and other organizations use energy more  efficiently by predicting, controlling and optimizing  their buildings™ energy profiles.
Sophisticated  cloud-based software creates predictive data by  anticipating a building™s energy profile by drawing   on multiple data sources, including weather  forecasts, expected occupancy levels and   periods of high renewable power generation.
Effectively, Grid Edge technology enables  customers to use their buildings™ ˚exibility in  energy demand and generation like a giant  battery, to reduce costs and carbon emissions.
Already in use in the UK in buildings such as  the Bullring shopping centre, Birmingham, and  Birmingham Airport, Grid Edge has helped  organizations to reduce energy costs and   carbon emissions.
Grid Edge supports our  strategy to create an   ecosystem of distinctive,   digitally-enabled, low   carbon businesses for   commercial and industrial   customers worldwide.ﬂ  Dev Sanyal Chief executive, BP Alternative Energy 33BP Chargemaster is powering  around 1.5 million electric miles  a week in the UK.
BP Ventures BP Ventures was set up more than 10 years ago   to identify and invest in private, high growth,   game-changing technology companies with the   potential to accelerate innovation across the   entire energy spectrum.
Today, it™s focused on   exploring new opportunities with the potential   to help us deliver the energy transition.
By creating new businesses, our ultimate ambition  is to build a thriving eco-system of lower carbon   energy and smart digital businesses.
Venturing   exposes us to the emerging technologies that will   shape the future and can help develop our   understanding of new business models.
Our corporate venturing activities include  investments in Grid Edge in the UK and R&B in   China.
Both companies use artificial intelligence   (AI) technology that enables customers to   predict, control and optimize their buildings™   energy profiles to achieve cost and carbon savings.
Backing electric vehicles (EVs)  We™ve grown our presence in EV charging in   recent years, with a focus on the key markets   of China, UK and Germany, where we aim to   build the fastest, most convenient networks   for EV customers.
We already have more than 7,500 charging  points across the UK through BP Chargemaster,   the country™s largest public electric charging   network, and in 2019 we began installing   150kW ultra-fast electric vehicle chargers at our   BP retail sites.
This new technology brings   charging for the next generation of EVs closer   to the speed and efficiency of refuelling a   passenger car with petrol.
All of the electricity   supplied through our public charging network is   certified as 100% renewable through the   Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin   (REGO) scheme.
And we™re exploring other   ultra-fast battery charging technologies through   our investments in StoreDot and FreeWire.
We™re working with car manufacturers to  develop lubricants that can help meet the  changing needs of vehicle engines.
For example,  we already supply e-transmission ˚uids to a  number of the world™s largest manufacturers  and we™re developing ˚uids that enable the use  of batteries with significantly enhanced thermal  management performance.
>$500m invested in low carbon activities in 2019 34Energy with purpose Building electric vehicle charging  networks in China Where better for BP to test our EV charging  aspirations at scale than in China?
The country  is home to the largest and fastest-developing EV  market, with 50% of all battery EVs currently  running on its roads.
We™re involved in a number of joint ventures and  are investing in innovative businesses.
These  include a joint venture with DiDi to provide  fast-charge and convenience services that use   DiDi™s app-based platform.
This platform is  currently accessed by around 550 million users  and serves one million EVs.
We™ve also opened the first BP-branded fuel  station that offers fast-charge services in China,  through a joint venture with Dongming  Petrochemical.

Why it matters Safety is a core value and creating a safe and  healthy workplace is our top priority, involving   everyone at BP.
Improving safety also makes    us a more efficient business.
What we value Cause no accidents, no harm to people and no   damage to the environment.
Our approach We focus on process safety, personal safety,   health and wellbeing, and security.
Ł We understand that even the best processes   can have weaknesses that may lead to   accidents, so we take steps to design these out Ł We focus on preventing incidents Œ reacting   swiftly and effectively if they happen Ł We learn from every incident Performance Ł We suffered two fatalities this year Œ you can   read more information on page 41 Ł Further improvements in our recordable injury   frequency (RIF) driven by a sustained focus   on personal safety over several years Ł An increase in tier 1 and tier 2 safety events   across the group, attributable mainly to   assets acquired over the past 18 months What™s next Ł Training 2,000 more leaders in safety through   our new ‚leading in operations™ programme Ł Launching new mental health training for   our line managers and starting to roll out our   wellbeing charter at all BP sites In this section Process safety 38Personal safety 39Safety performance 41 Safety 36Energy with purpose means  prioritizing people™s health  and safety 37 Introduction Sustainability at BP Our focus areas Doing business  responsibly  Governance Our reporting  Pipe mapping: corrosion  management at our US  Whiting refinery.
Spills and spill prevention We™ve made good progress in preventing   and reducing spills over the past 10 years.
This re˚ects the targeted actions we™ve taken   to improve performance.
However, in 2019 we   saw an increase in the total number of oil spills b from 124 in 2018 to 152.
This is mainly due to   acquisitions over the past 18 months but we are   taking steps to improve the performance of   these assets Over several years we™ve focused on building  competency across BP, resulting in a safe   system of work, which supports the identification   of process safety risks and a reduction in spills.
We™re sustaining this through training in key   processes, such as isolations or re-instatements   and the operation of valves, carried out by our   operators.
We choose the most appropriate   investigation methodology, depending on an   incident™s severity and complexity.
The most   robust methodology we use, for investigating   the most serious and complex incidents, is the   ‚logic tree™.
This is BP investigation training   and certification which has been externally   accredited by The National Examination Board   in Occupational Safety and Health.
Our risk process has been implemented across  the group and is continuously updated to help   enable us to use the most effective processes   and tools.
In Upstream, all of our regions   develop annual loss of primary containment   (LOPC) plans, which address the key measures   they need to take to prevent LOPCs, which   comprise the vast majority of all spills.
The   regions collaborate with each other to share   best practice and a central team works to make   sure that any systemic gaps are closed rapidly.
20 April 2020 marks 10 years since  Deepwater Horizon Making BP safer, reducing risk and rebuilding  trust was the key focus of the 10-point plan  that Bob Dudley, then our chief executive,  announced in 2011.
A decade later, we™ve achieved  improvements in our safety performance  through training and technology, heightened  standards and continuing work on incident  prevention.
Our BP values and behaviours   are embedded across the group.
They  continue to reinforce systemic working and  an open culture where people feel  empowered to speak up if they believe  something is not right.
Human performance People™s actions and decisions are in˚uenced   by the conditions in which they work: the   processes they follow, the equipment and   systems they use and their surrounding   environment Œ these all make a difference.
We can improve or redesign these aspects to   reduce the likelihood of human error.
To do   this, we™re making greater use of human   performance techniques.
Steered by our group operations and risk  committee, we focus on building capability Œ   embedding good human performance   approaches and skills so that everyone involved   in a process can support safety.
We have a   number of subject matter experts and human   performance champions, all actively involved   across our Upstream, Downstream and other   businesses and corporate segments.
At the end   of 2019, our BP businesses had human   performance strategies in place and around   9,000 of our people had completed human   performance e-learning modules.
Process safety We want to improve safety through  the equipment and systems we use.
We do this by applying good   practice in their design and   implementation and by planning   every stage of our operations with   safety risks and their mitigation   in mind.
Through our operating   management system (OMS) we   work to reduce the number and   severity of process safety events.
In 2019, the total number of tier 1 and 2 a incidents increased, mainly re˚ecting  performance in assets acquired over the past   18 months.
Removing these assets for a   year-on-year comparison, the total reduced   slightly in 2019 and represented a 32%   reduction over the past five years.
Each of these incidents has been or is being  investigated so that lessons are learned about   how we can improve performance.
We will   continue to focus on improving the safety   performance of our assets.
We work in partnership with industry experts  and host governments to prevent and reduce   the impact of spills.
In 2019 we took part in   large scale oil spill prevention training exercises   in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.
a  Tier 1 events are losses of primary containment from a  process of greatest consequence Œ causing harm to a  member of the workforce, damage to equipment from a fire  or explosion, a community impact or exceeding defined  quantities.
Tier 2 events are those of lesser consequence.
b The number of accidental or unplanned losses of  hydrocarbon from primary containment from a BP or   contractor operation, irrespective of any secondary  containment or recovery.
Oil spills > 1bbl are defined as  any liquid hydrocarbon release of more than, or equal to,   one barrel (159 litres, equivalent to 42 US gallons).
38Personal safety We focus on keeping our employees  and contractors safe and alert to   potential hazards in their workplaces.
We™ve taken several important actions to improve  road safety for those driving on behalf of BP and   for vehicle passengers in 2019.
Following the   fatality in our US lubricants business in 2018,   we ran a campaign specifically focused on   vehicle breakdown safety and have mandated   the carrying of safety vests in the vehicle for   use during breakdown procedures.
We™re making   it a requirement that an appropriate emergency   response plan is in place for ‚higher risk driving   activities™ and we have also mandated the use   of in-vehicle cameras for vehicles undertaking   these activities.
These vehicles include   multi-passenger transport vehicles, such as   coaches, buses and minibuses as well as   vehicles used to transport dangerous goods,   including fuel tankers.
All vehicles in these   categories, operated by BP, will be retrofitted   to carry cameras over the next two years.
Health and wellbeing  Health and wellbeing are inextricably linked to   safety in the workplace.
We take a proactive   approach by designing employee wellbeing   into our operations and continuously identifying   areas for improvement.
Fatigue is defined as a lack of mental alertness  arising from lack of sleep.
It can affect performance,   putting individuals and their teams at risk.
We™ve developed group guidance on fatigue   management, working in collaboration with   leaders in health in the upstream part of our   business.
This approach now applies to all BP   businesses globally.
Collaboration and sharing experience   BP™s Upstream global operations organization   hosts an annual industry conference to   strengthen safety through collaboration and   shared experience.
In 2019, CEOs and safety   leaders from more than 20 key suppliers,   together with leaders from Total, Shell and   Chevron, attended a safety leadership and   human performance event in Baku, Azerbaijan.
Participants visited BP-operated sites and   gained hands-on experience and understanding   of a key aspect of human performance Œ   identifying the gaps between ‚work as we   believe it™s done™ and ‚work as it™s actually   done™.
Following the conference, attendees felt   better equipped to build human performance   processes into their operations.
Covering both process and personal safety,  ‚leading in operations™ (LiO) is our new training   approach to operational safety leadership.
Designed to help us develop world-class   operational leaders who are well equipped   and highly capable, it™s delivered through a mix   of site visits, face-to-face and online learning   and coaching Œ providing those who complete   it with a network they can use to learn, share,   discuss and continuously improve safety.
Our aim is to put around 2,000 BP operations   leaders through LiO.
We continue to learn lessons from the aviation  and nuclear industries about how to design the   workplace around people to improve safety.
We have shared our resulting capability   development programme through the Energy   Institute, so that our energy sector peers can   access the working knowledge we™ve gained   on human performance.
Our aim is to support   the growth of human performance skills across   the industry.
During 2019, we™ve revised our fatigue   awareness & countermeasures training (FACT)   for employees in order to make it more effective.
The new training will be more focused, covering   two key issues: the importance of recognizing   fatigue and the importance of good quality   sleep.
Employees will also be able to access   further training through FACT, including how to   manage issues relating to shift work, commuting   and jet lag.
The new training is set to be   launched later in 2020.
In many countries psychological health is  included in workplace regulations and at BP the   requirement in our OMS to identify and reduce   work-related health risks includes mental health.
It™s also important to recognize that work can   have a positive impact on mental health by   providing people with the opportunities to use   and develop their skills, increase motivation,   challenge their thinking and interact with others.
We take the mental health of our employees   and contractors very seriously.
In 2019 we ran   an awareness campaign across BP as part of   our increased focus on mental health.
We also   expanded our promotion of the employee   assistance programme across the business,   aiming to reach more employees and explain the   benefits of using it.
In 2020 we will be launching   new mental health training for our line managers   and starting to roll out our wellbeing charter to   all BP sites.
Energy with purpose Collaborating for better safety  performance Our biofuels business has collaborated with BP  safety and operational risk experts to build a more  effective safety culture.
As it is across BP, safety is the number one priority  for BP biofuels.
However, with operations spread  across many locations and a large workforce  comprising both BP employees and contractors,  it™s also a major challenge.
Active collaboration involved the development of  more and better targeted safety communications,   bespoke commitment workshops to change  mindsets, and continuous improvement projects  to build personal empowerment.
The result is a  reduction in biofuels™ rolling recordable injury  frequency of 24% between November 2018 and  November 2019.
39We use drones to visually  inspect operations at our US  Whiting refinery.
Safety through technology We believe technology, particularly the use of   robotics, can transform BP Œ helping us deliver   safer, more reliable and competitive operations   while reducing our carbon footprint.
Robotics   has the potential to deliver this impact across   the breadth and lifecycle of our operations Œ   from surveying in deserts to decommissioning   in deep water.
In a first for our industry, we™ve piloted  technology to measure methane emissions   from remote offshore platforms in the North   Sea, using a drone that has its origins in the   hunt for life on Mars.
It circled our Clair platform   for around 90 minutes while live-streaming data   for analysis, completing what may have been   the longest civilian drone ˚ight ever undertaken   in the UK Œ more than 185 kilometres.
We have   plans to roll this methane detection capability   out across our North Sea assets in 2020.
We now use drones routinely to perform visual  inspection tasks, which reduces the need for   people to work at heights.
Their use also   enables us to keep hot turbine exhausts or ˚are   stacks operating during inspections, avoiding   the increases in emissions that occur during   plant shutdown and restart.
We™re also testing the use of drones to operate  in confined spaces Œ for example the cargo   tanks in our ˚oating production systems in   Angola Œ and trialling crawling robots.
At our   Cherry Point refinery in Washington, US, these   are being used to spot microscopic cracks in the   internal walls of our hydrocracker reactor.
Energy with purpose Using maritime robotics to  improve safety A new wave of marine and subsea robots is  revolutionizing how we understand our  underwater operating environment.
These  maritime robots, more generally known as  unmanned surface vessels and unmanned  underwater vehicles, are loaded with sensors  and cameras to capture data from the oceans  safely and efficiently.
Using these robots rather than a conventional  large ship for the same task, could enhance  safety by taking crew out of harm™s way.
The use of unmanned vessels now forms a part  of our maritime autonomous systems strategy,  which involves evaluating and piloting new  robotic technologies.
Security  Hostile actions, including cyber attacks, could   harm our people or disrupt our operations.
These actions might be connected to political   or social unrest, terrorism, armed con˚ict or   criminal activity.
We take these potential threats seriously   and assess them continuously.
Our 24-hour  response information centre in the UK monitors   global events with these threats in mind.
The centre uses state-of-the-art technology   to monitor evolving high-risk situations in  real time.
It helps us to assess the safety of our  people and provide them with practical advice  if there™s an emergency.
This year, we faced a number of protests.
We worked with local police, including marine  authorities, to minimize any disruption from these  to our operations.
40This work includes recognizing safety-related  improvements.
We do this in a number of   ways including our BP Helios awards and our   downstream ‚Believe in Zero™ awards.
In 2019   the safety-related category of our Helios awards   received 127 entries across 40 countries.
‚Believe in Zero™ recognized 47 downstream   sites for their outstanding safety performance   during the year.
Cyber threats  The severity, sophistication and scale of cyber   attacks continue to evolve.
The increasing   digitalization and reliance on IT systems makes   managing cyber risk an even greater priority   for many industries, including our own.
The risk   comes from a variety of cyber threat actors,   including nation states, criminals, terrorists,   hacktivists and insiders.
As with previous years,   we have experienced threats to the security of   our digital infrastructure, but none of these had   a significant impact on our business in 2019.
To encourage vigilance among our employees,   our cyber security training and awareness   programme covers topics such as phishing   and the correct classification and handling of   our information.
We also collaborate closely   with governments, law enforcement and   industry peers to understand and respond   to new and emerging threats.
At our security operations centre we track and  take steps to combat any attempts to breach   our cyber security and also help to shape and   co-ordinate appropriate training and advice for   employees.
More than 70,000 employees and   contractors completed mandatory training in 2019.
Safety performance  We track our safety performance  using industry standard metrics   and work continuously to improve   all aspects of our performance.
Our focus on safety has resulted   in steady improvement against   international oil and gas industry   benchmarks.
Tragically, we suffered two fatalities in 2019.
In July, a fire-fighting assistant in our biofuels   business in Brazil was fatally injured following   a fire truck accident while attending to an   agricultural fire.
In October, a contractor at our   Whiting refinery in the US was fatally injured   when he fell from a scaffold ladder.
We are   deeply saddened by these losses and continue   to work towards eliminating injuries and   fatalities in our work.
a Tier 1 events are losses of primary containment from a process of greatest consequence Œ causing harm to a member of the workforce, damage to equipment from a fire or explosion, a  community impact or exceeding defined quantities.
Tier 2 events are those of lesser consequence.
b API and IOGP 2019 data reports are not available until May 2020. c The number of reported work-related incidents that result in a fatality or injury.
d The number of incidents that resulted in an injury where a person is unable to work for a day (or shift) or more.
Process safety The total number of tier 1 and 2 incidents increased in  2019, mainly re˚ecting performance in assets  acquired over the past 18 months.
Removing these  assets for a year-on-year comparison, the total  reduced slightly in 2019, and represented a 32%  reduction over the past five years.
Personal safety Our recordable injury frequency (RIF) continues to show a downwards trend, with fewer recordable   injuries than in any year since our records began.
RIF reduced by 16% in 2019 including the addition  of BHP assets, representing an overall reduction of 32% over the past five years Œ this equates to  155 fewer recordable injuries in our facilities.

We make a contribution to societies   around the world, as an energy provider, employer, taxpayer, supply   chain participant and investor in local communities.
As an energy provider Ł We provide heat and light for homes, fuel for mobility and power for industry Ł Our products and services improve the quality of life for millions of people,  helping to lift them out of poverty and to meet their needs and aspirations As an investor in local communities Ł We engage with local communities to provide   sustainable benefits Ł We invest in sustainable development projects   that align with local needs As a taxpayer Ł We make a direct contribution to economies Ł We manage our tax affairs fairly and transparently Ł We publish an annual document outlining our   approach to tax at  bp.com/revenuetransparency As an employer Ł We create jobs and support local businesses   around the world  Ł We aim to recruit nationally and locally  Ł We succeed by investing in the professional   development of our employees As a supply chain participant Ł We try to procure goods and services from local   suppliers whenever practical Ł We hold our suppliers to our high standards  Ł We support ethical employment practices and the   fight against bribery and corruption Communities Supporting efforts   to improve standards   of living Suppliers Sourcing goods and   services from around  50,000 suppliers  Governments Contributing to economies   through the taxes we pay Economic value   generated by BP Employees Providing jobs for 70,100  people worldwide $233.6bn $9.8bn $6.9bn $0.1bn $283.3bn 44Social investment We make targeted social investments  that contribute to sustainable   development.
These support our   community engagement and align   with specific local needs.
Generally, we focus on economic development,  education, environmental programmes and   engagement with culture and the arts.
In 2019   our social investments included funding from   BP Angola for the Halo Trust, which trains local   women as ‚deminers™ to help find and clear   landmines.
Thanks to this investment, the Halo   Trust has employed 31 new staff as it works to   help the government reach its target of making   Angola landmine free by 2025.
Another   example of the investments made in 2019 is   BP South Africa™s partnership with the National   Empowerment Fund to create an enterprise   development fund that provides funding,   mentoring and business development coaching   for those working in our dealer network, with   a particular focus on helping black women.
Improving access to energy can help people   build better lives for themselves.
In India, we™re   working with the Clean Energy Access Network   (CLEAN) to give local people the skills required   to work in the energy generation sector, which   has the potential to bring clean energy, such as   solar, to people in rural areas.
As this sector   grows in India, these skills will be critical in   ensuring the long-term efficiency of power   generation equipment.
Providing this training   can also play a key role in mitigating rural-to-  urban migration which is a problem in many   rural communities.
In the UK we also invest to develop talent in our  local communities through our support of STEM   subjects (science, technology, engineering   and maths).

Currently  these villages receive a very unreliable source  of water for drinking.
BP is financing the upgrade  of a pumping station and treatment plant, water   distribution system and storage system to  improve the volume and reliability of drinking  water to around 7,200 people (in 2018), and to  accommodate an expected increase in population  to 11,500 by 2038.
This scheme is currently  under development.
BP Foundation The BP Foundation provides money for  humanitarian relief activities around the  world.
It also matches personal contributions  from BP employees that are made to eligible  charities of their choice.
Ł $9.1 million in employee contributions  that the BP Foundation supplemented  with grants of $8.3 million Ł $358,000 contributed to local communities  affected by extreme events, including: Ł $150,000 to support International   Red Cross relief efforts in Mozambique  and Zimbabwe after cyclone Idai Ł $100,000 to the Australian Red Cross to  support disaster relief efforts following   the Australian bush fires Supporting a ‚just transition™ We™re participating in the wider global   conversation around climate change and the   energy transition.
For example, BP employees   have taken part in Vatican Dialogues on this   topic and we™ve engaged with external groups   to improve our understanding of the issues   involved in a just transition.
We believe our   engagement and investments in local communities   where we work can help make sure that they   benefit from a just transition to a lower carbon   future.
This is the case for a number of our   initiatives, including our access to energy   projects in Indonesia and in Angola.
45In 2019, 92% of our workforce in  Azerbaijan were Azerbaijani nationals.
In Tangguh, through internships and apprenticeships,  we™re aiming for an 85% Papuan workforce   by 2029.
We™re also helping local people to   establish businesses.
In Senegal we™ve helped   local businesses to meet our high standards   for suppliers.
We™ve applied a due diligence   process to assess supplier track record, which   helps them identify ways of strengthening their   alignment with international standards.
The   outcome in 2019 was that more local companies   conform to international standards and some   have become BP suppliers since 2006.
Local workers and suppliers Whenever possible, we try to recruit  our workforce from the community   or country in which we™re based.
In   some places, governments require   this, but it™s our approach wherever   we work because we believe it   benefits both local communities   and BP.
Local knowledge is invaluable and we try to  support local workers with capability development   programmes.
We™ve done this around the world   over the past few years.
In the West Nile Delta,   we provided training on vocational skills and   health and safety standards for local people.
We reached more than 2,000 people by the   end of 2019.

We set   out our commitments in our human   rights policy and code of conduct,   and our operating management   system contains requirements and   guidance on respecting the rights of   workers and community members.
We respect internationally recognized human  rights as set out in the International Bill of   Human Rights and the International Labour   Organization™s Declaration on Fundamental   Principles at Work, including the Core   Conventions.
These conventions are particularly   pertinent as many accepted workforce norms   and standards are based on them.
They   underpin our own BP human rights policy.
Security and human rights  We work with our security providers to   reinforce the importance of respecting human   rights.
We support the Voluntary Principles on   Security and Human Rights, which guide the   way we work with security forces.
In line with   the principles, we emphasize the need to   understand and respect the human rights of   our workforce and people living in communities   near our operations.
We provide training on the   principles for employees who are accountable   for managing security and conduct assessments   to identify ways in which we can help them   to improve.
We are incorporating the UN Guiding Principles   on Business and Human Rights, which set   out how companies should prevent, address   and remedy human rights impacts, into our   business processes.
When working to remediate any impacts on  the rights of local communities we are open   to co-operating in good faith to agree remedial   actions through state-led mechanisms such   as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation   and Development national contact points.
We recognize the importance of accessible   and effective operational-level grievance   mechanisms in addressing our impacts.

In 2019 it provided full scholarships for 79 senior  high school and university students.
Training and  mentoring have also been provided for more than  300 education agency staff and teachers.
To help meet its commitment to have an 85%  Papuan workforce by 2029, Tangguh runs internship  and apprentice programmes.
In 2019 108 Papuans   were enrolled in its technician apprentice  programme, 32 of them going on to work in  operations.
Papuans accounted for 61% of the  workforce in Tangguh operations at the end of  2019 and made up 20% of those working on its  expansion programme.
Tangguh has supported public health programmes  in selected villages since 2004, including efforts   to combat malaria.
In 2019 the malaria incident  rate was 0.02%.
In 2019 Tangguh and the local  government established an emergency service  to help local women give birth safely.
Energy with purpose Supporting local communities  at BP Tangguh LNG Tangguh LNG in Papua, Barat Province, Indonesia,  supports local efforts to enhance the quality of  life of local communities through participative and  accountable development practices that contribute  to operational sustainability.
Most of the communities surrounding Tangguh  LNG rely on fishing, so we engage with fishermen  and local authorities to minimize disturbances  to their fishing grounds.
From 2018 to 2019   Tangguh also purchased local produce and fish  worth $2.1 million from the local community for  catering in its operations.
We help local suppliers to develop their business  skills through the Tangguh indigenous enterprise  development programme, set up in 2016.
By the end of 2019 more than 200 entrepreneurs  and local businesses had received training and  mentoring.
Tangguh™s efforts since 2006 helped   54 Papuan companies to become contractors with  total contracts worth more than $250 million.
Community engagement We engage with local communities  to help prevent or reduce the risks   and impacts of our operations,   in ways that can directly benefit   them if possible.
We focus at a local level, concentrating on  the varied circumstances we meet wherever   we operate or plan to do so.
We engage with   local communities throughout the life cycle   of our operations, from planning through   active operations to decommissioning and   site remediation.
We aim to minimize the impacts that our  presence could have on local communities   and to ensure they benefit from our activities.
We also want to reduce and mitigate the   impacts our operations may present to the   livelihoods, land, environment, cultural   heritage, health and wellbeing of local   people, including indigenous people.
We work with humility and try to earn local  people™s trust through our transparency   and actions.
We need their local skills and   knowledge, as employees and stakeholders.
Their co-operation is key to ensuring the   success of our businesses.
We engage with local people and their  representative bodies, listening to their   concerns and learning from them.
Our aim   is to find ways of working that deliver mutual   benefit, balancing their needs with our   business goals.
Engaging throughout the project lifecycle Our social engagement strategies respect   local circumstances and the needs of   communities at different stages of the   project lifecycle.
We engage through our   community liaison officers (CLOs), who play   a key role in building trust at a local level.
CLOs manage our day-to-day relations with local  communities and other stakeholders affected by   and living close to our projects and operations.
They™re the key contact for community   members who want to engage with BP.
CLOs   handle community requests and grievances   Œ promptly, fairly and consistently.
They work   hard to build relationships based on trust and   mutual respect and provide support during   the implementation of community development   initiatives designed to improve health and   safety, education and capacity building.
We engage with local communities from the  early stages of projects and as an ongoing   process, always respecting local legislation   and culture.
As an example of early stage   engagement, in 2019 we involved local   communities in The Gambia in assessing   potential impacts before carrying out any   offshore exploration activities.
48The Mayaro Initiative for Private Enterprise  Development is a funding model for  entrepreneurs in Mayaro, Trinidad.
Our impact on communities We recognize that our activities can  have a negative impact on the rights of   people in communities near our sites.
We screen our projects to minimize the risk of  this happening and work with local people to   prevent, reduce and manage any impacts that   occur.
For example, in Mauritania and Senegal,   we™ve developed a framework for engagement   with local fishing communities.
We™ve put in   place community liaison officers to provide a   focal point for contact, introduced feedback and   grievance mechanisms, and forged strong links   with the community council, which represents   local stakeholders.
Using a project patrol boat   has also helped us and local fishermen to avoid   unauthorized vessels from entering the safety   exclusion zones near to our operations.
Community feedback We have operational-level community grievance   mechanisms in place to capture feedback,   including complaints.
This can come through   direct engagement with BP employees,   especially community liaison officers, and   by email or telephone.
We try to respond to   substantiated complaints promptly and when   we™ve caused or contributed to any adverse   impact, we provide or co-operate in providing   remediation through legitimate processes.
In 2018 we issued guidance on community  complaints mechanisms, in line with the   UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human   Rights criteria.
As a result, in 2019 we engaged   relevant businesses and provided training on   how to manage grievances effectively.
We also   developed new requirements for community   grievance mechanisms in our operating   management system.
In 2019, most of the concerns raised by people  living near our projects and operations related   to damage to their property or crops and also   to job opportunities.
Overall, the number of   complaints decreased.
We attribute this to   the fact that key projects have now become   steady-state operations.
In Azerbaijan, throughout the Shah Deniz 2  and South Caucasus Pipeline Expansion (SCPX)  projects and subsequently in the operations phase,   we™ve worked closely with the communities   affected by our activities, engaging with them   to communicate and explain the processes we   use to manage community concerns and social   risks.
This and the completion of project activities   in mid-2018 has resulted in a significant decrease   in the number of SCPX community complaints,   from 47 in 2018 to 25 in 2019.
All complaints have   been addressed and closed.
In many cases our community engagement and  grievance management mechanisms are open   to stakeholder monitoring, such as project   leaders™ consultant reports and site visits.
In   addition, information on our social performance   is widely shared with the relevant communities,   as well as local and international NGOs.
In 2019 we engaged with Crude Accountability Œ   a US NGO promoting environmental and human   rights in the extractive industries Œ in order to   discuss our community engagement processes.

BP labour rights and modern  slavery principles We™re committed to respecting workers™  rights, in line with the International Labour   Organisation Core Conventions on Rights   at Work and we expect our contractors,   suppliers and joint ventures we participate   in to do the same.
Our expectation is that workers in our  operations, joint ventures and supply chains   are not subject to abusive or inhumane   practices, such as child labour, forced   labour, trafficking, slavery or servitude,   discrimination, or harassment.
To assist in communicating these  expectations to our businesses, contractors   and suppliers we™ve developed the BP   labour rights and modern slavery principles.
The principles clarify our position on a range   of issues, including workers having clear   employment contracts, employer-pays   principles in relation to recruitment fees,   and not withholding worker passport or   identity documents.
They build on and add   to the existing high-level requirements and   expectations in our code of conduct, human   rights policy and supplier expectations.
The principles are now being cascaded through  our businesses and will be communicated to   our contractors and suppliers through our   procurement processes.
Read more on  bp.com/modernslavery .Labour rights We respect the rights of our  workforce and people working at   our sites, including those working   through our contractors and   suppliers.
These commitments   are included in our code of conduct   and human rights policy.
In our 2018 report, we highlighted concerns  related to workforce welfare and labour rights   standards that were identified through onsite   assessments undertaken as part of our   risk-prioritized modern slavery risk management.
We used the learnings from the 2018 assessments   to inform the development of a more systematic   approach to managing labour rights and modern   slavery risk.
In 2019 we developed and issued the BP labour  rights and modern slavery principles, which   have been approved by our group operating   and risk committee.
New requirements and guidance on identifying  and managing labour rights and modern slavery   risks have been introduced into our operating   management system to support conformance   to the principles.
This will help our businesses   to assess the risk and put in place effective   controls in a proportionate and systematic way,   building on existing processes such as supplier   pre-contract due diligence, worker induction   and contractor management.
Working with contractors and suppliers  In 2019 we continued working with our   contractors and suppliers in response to   the labour rights issues and modern slavery   indicators identified during modern slavery   risk reviews in previous years.
ŁThe dry dock yard that provides maintenance  and repair services to BP shipping in Dubai  has agreed a corrective action plan to address  issues among their contractors including  remediation of recruitment fees and  passport retention.
ŁIn Malaysia, a supplier for which we™ve  undertaken a pilot labour rights assessment,  has completed corrective actions relating  to the recruitment and employment of  foreign workers.
ŁAt Oman™s Khazzan and Ghazeer fields,  systematic monitoring processes have been  put in place, including pre-deployment  checks and site walkovers and worker  surveys.
The number of workers charged  recruitment fees in the last two years when  mobilized to the site has been significantly  reduced.
In addition, a contractor self-  verification process to assess conformance  with BP Oman™s worker welfare and human  rights policy has been put in place and is  regularly reviewed by BP.
ŁIn Mauritania and Senegal, we™ve put in place  action plans with certain contractors and  suppliers to correct issues around inadequate  grievance procedures, poor communication  of policies and unclear wage information.
50Energy with purpose Supporting labour rights in Malaysia Following an audit in 2017,  which identified a  number of issues relating  to  the labour rights of  foreign workers employed  by  five third party  service companies, the BP  Port Klang lubricants  plant in Malaysia has taken positive and effective  action to rectify them.Around 90 BP employees and 250 contractors work at the plant of which fewer than 0 re foreign workers.
The audit highlighted issues faced by the foreign workers at the plant including unlawful recruitment fees, salary deductions and unclear or a lack of formal recruitment policies, processes and terms of employment.
It also highlighted the need for greater oversight of these service companies.Working with others in our industry We™re working with others in our industry to   find ways of standardizing our human rights   due diligence and assessment processes.
Together we™ve developed a system that   enables participating energy companies to   share contractors™ responses to a standard   human rights due diligence questionnaire.
This approach encourages focus on   shared industry expectations for labour   rights performance and means contractors   need to make just one rather than multiple   submissions to energy companies.
It also enables BP and other participants to  improve due diligence and respect for human   rights in our supply chains.
In response a number of new measures were  introduced.
These included modern slavery and   labour rights risks training for plant management   and daily site walkovers by BP site supervisors to   engage with workers, inform them of their rights   and encourage them to speak out about issues.
The service companies identified in the audit were  required to attend two days of modern slavery   and labour rights training provided at the plant   to understand the local context and discuss how   some existing site processes could be used to   support improved labour rights management.
These service companies were also required to   make certain commitments on modern slavery   and labour rights.
The plant made sure that BP   labour rights principles are made clearer to  contractors, are explained during induction   sessions, and are included in the specialist training   introduced for high risk contractors in 2019.
Contractors can raise grievances through formal  and informal channels.
These grievances are   then followed up and resolved with the relevant   contractor companies using the BP labour rights   and modern slavery principles as the basis for the   discussion.
Further actions planned for 2020 include a third  party review of the corrective actions being taken   by the service companies and a resourcing review   including appointment by BP of a dedicated   modern slavery and labour rights resource for   the country.

During 2019 we reviewed and strengthened the  group-wide environmental and social requirements   that support the OMS.
These new group-level   requirements now apply to operations as well   as projects.
They cover relevant aspects of   environmental and social practices, mandate   carbon management plans for all operations   above a threshold, and require closer   engagement with local communities.
The new   requirements will be rolled out from January   2020 and any new projects starting after this   date will adhere to them.
Existing operations will   be developing conformance plans to implement   the new requirements in 2020.
Energy with purpose means  valuing and protecting our planet™s  natural resources Our review builds on the work we™ve done to  integrate the requirements of ISO 14001 into   our OMS.
In 2017 we introduced an innovative   approach to this standard, which we call   ‚attestation™.
This approach, which is driving   performance improvements, has established   a robust system, based on self-verification,   management review and accredited independent   third-party reviews and audits.
We™ve adapted   our OMS to require that all major operating sites   are required to attest or certify to ISO 14001.
100% of our major operating sites required to  attest or certify to ISO 14001 We respect the environments in  which we operate.
We also respect   the communities that depend on   these environments for resources   to support their livelihoods.
We approach every major project aiming to  understand and sustain the local environment   through reciprocal engagement with local   communities.
To identify potential impacts,   we carry out detailed environmental and social   assessments before starting major projects.
In 2019 we updated our requirements and   associated guidance in our operating management   system (OMS), for sites to effectively mitigate   their environmental and social impacts through   the mitigation hierarchy.
We believe that incorporating the principles of  circular business models can help us use natural   resources, including waste from projects, in   a more sustainable way.
Read more on  page 29 .Project process Planning We complete a screening  process to identify potential  positive and adverse impacts,  covering: Ł Biodiversity and protected   areas Ł Freshwater Ł Air quality Ł Waste and wastewater Ł Local employment Ł Community health, safety   and human rights Design and construction We use the results of our   screening process to help  us identify: Ł Adverse impact and risk  mitigation measures Ł Development opportunities  Ł Actions during project   development, including  detailed impact assessments Operations Every year, we carry out  performance reviews and agree  local actions for any ‚issue™  areas.
These could include: Ł Noise and odour Ł Flaring  Ł Air emissions Ł Water use Decommissioning We take environmental factors   into account when we  decommission our projects,  focusing on: Ł Ways to reuse materials Ł Appropriate disposal Ł Remediation of sites to   their original state before  BP arrived 55Decommissioning We take environmental factors into account  when we decommission or close down a site,   paying particular attention to how we can reuse,   recycle or appropriately dispose of materials.
We announced our agreement to divest our  assets in Alaska in 2019 but will continue to be   involved in decommissioning the Trans-Alaska   Pipeline System.
In the area of the North Sea   where we operated North West Hutton until   2009, our marine analysis has shown   colonization by cold-water coral on the seabed   since decommissioning that contains species   found in natural cold-water coral reefs.
We see waste from decommissioning as an  opportunity to reuse and recycle materials back   into the production system rather than sending   them to landfill.
Of the steel taken from four   tanks at a former refinery on the Isle of Grain   in the UK when they were demolished in 2019,   99% was recycled.
Similarly high recycling rates   for other platforms were achieved, including   the removal of the Miller platform in 2018.
This involved moving 40,000 tonnes of material,   mainly steel, onshore where 97% of all   materials are set to be reused or recycled.
Sensitive areas   and biodiversity We support international efforts to rapidly halt   the decline in biodiversity and recognize the   need to conserve sensitive areas that house   our planet™s rich natural and cultural heritage.
We assess our potential impacts on biodiversity  when we plan new projects and we aim to   avoid activities in sensitive areas.
If activities are   likely to take us into or close to an international   protected area, we carry out a detailed risk   assessment and require executive approval   before any physical activities are undertaken.
Through our new group practice we set a   requirement to achieve no net loss when   undertaking new projects in sensitive areas.
No major operated project has entered an  international protected area since 2006 and we   have no existing operations or projects inside   UNESCO World Heritage sites.
No new   requests to enter an international protected area   were submitted in 2019.
For a full list of our major operating sites in  or close to international protected areas see  bp.com/protectedareas .
We review BP activities in or near protected  areas each year and disclose where BP is   operating.
We also engage with others to make   sure we keep up to speed with best practice,   including conservation organizations such as   Conservation International, Fauna & Flora   International and The Nature Conservancy.
In addition, academic research helps us to   understand biodiversity trends, issues and   threats.
For example, in Mauritania and Senegal   we are working with national and international   scientists on the Biodiversity Action Plan for   the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim development.
We recognize the important intrinsic links  between climate change and biodiversity and   we™re making investments in natural climate   solutions including REDD (reducing emissions   from deforestation and degradation).
2020 is set to be an important year for biodiversity,  with the launch of the new post-2020 global   biodiversity framework.
We welcome this   framework and will be looking at our own   approach to the topic and working with IPIECA   on developing industry good-practice guidance   on the implementation of the framework for the   oil and gas sector.

The programme  aims to help improve knowledge and  understanding of the presence and movement of  marine mammals and sea turtles around São  Tomé.
This includes an acoustic marine mammal   and soundscape study using a combination of  fixed passive acoustic recorders and an  autonomous surface vehicle to collect data over  a wide area.
We™re also supporting the local NGO Programa  Tatô to monitor sea turtle nesting and tagging  turtles to see where they are going during and  after nesting.
The data from these surveys is not only helping to  understand the ecology of these species, but also  helps inform our planned activities and avoid the  most sensitive areas and times of the year.
56Water Water is a precious natural resource but also  a valuable commodity.
This is why we actively   manage and monitor our water use and take   steps to use it more sparingly and sustainably.
We actively manage our freshwater demands  in areas of stress and scarcity.
Based on   analysis using the World Resources Institute   Aqueduct Global Water Risk Atlas, in 2019 four   of our 26 major operating sites were located in   regions with high or extremely high water   stress, with another four located in areas of   medium to high water stress.
Energy with purpose Cooling water management at  Texas City Chemicals One of the major demands for freshwater is  for cooling in our refining and petrochemical  operations.
Balancing the corrosion, scaling and  microbiological risks of the cooling water while  minimizing the volume of freshwater required for  optimum cooling performance is a routine  challenge at these operations.
At Texas City Chemicals, located in an area of  medium to high water stress, we undertook a   detailed monitoring and modelling study to improve  cooling water quality and reduce freshwater  demands to optimize the cooling tower operation.
This involved a collaborative approach from BP  and our suppliers to test different cooling cycles  (the number of times cooling water can safely be  recycled before being replenished with fresh   water) and different chemical treatments to  optimize the water chemistry.
Through modelling and monitoring we have been  able to lower the demand for fresh water by over  270,000m 3 per year.
We will continue to reduce the  fresh water requirement by optimizing cooling   tower operations and reducing chemicals usage.
In addition, only 4% of our total freshwater  withdrawal was from regions of high or   extremely high, water stress.
We review water risks every year, taking into  account availability, quantity, quality and   regulatory requirements.
We also use a range   of tools, including the Global Environmental   Management Initiative Local Water Tool and   the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Global   Water Risk Atlas.
In 2019 we saw a 4% rise in freshwater  withdrawals and a 3% rise in freshwater   consumption.
This was largely due to increased   production, with the freshwater withdrawal   and consumption intensities remaining ˚at   compared with 2018.

Waste Our waste includes oil-derived substances,  inorganic chemicals, steel, office paper and   many other materials.
Some waste streams are   non-hazardous and others potentially harmful,   so we use a wide range of technologies to   treat and manage them effectively.
In terms of   decommissioning our operations, a very high   proportion of materials are reused or recycled,   often in other industries.
On a day-to-day basis   we manage waste generated from operations,   maintenance service and obsolete stock with   a clear focus to try reducing waste production   at source.
We™re exploring ways to create a more detailed  picture of our waste footprint.
In 2019 we carried   out various activities to explore the basis for a   circular approach to waste.
Building on this, we   will continue to look for ways to further improve   our management of waste including using   learnings to further develop our waste strategy.
Air emissions  We understand that people around the world   are increasingly concerned about air quality   and its impact on public health.
We monitor   our air emissions and put measures in place to   reduce the potential impact of our activities on   local communities.
In our unconventional gas operations in the US,  we reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by using   lower sulphur fuels in our drilling rig engines   and hydraulic stimulation equipment.
In 2019, we took delivery of the last three  vessels in our new ˚eet of six liquefied natural   gas (LNG) carriers.
These use around 25% less   fuel and emit less nitrogen oxides than the older   LNG carriers in the BP-operated ˚eet.

We™re working to improve our understanding  of the severe weather risks we face.
We™ve   reviewed the way they™re documented across   BP, with the intention to develop an appropriately   standardized approach.
We track relevant external   risk indices and academic advances in climate   and severe weather science and modelling,   while also maintaining modelling capability   and the relevant tools to help us meet critical   business needs.
We™ve already carried out severe weather  risk assessments at a number of our assets   and have prioritized additional assets for   assessment across our Upstream,   Downstream and Alternative Energy businesses.
We actively participate in relevant industry  forums and initiatives, including development   of the IOGP Recommended Practice document   on assessing severe weather and climate   change, and the IPIECA Adaptation and   Resiliency taskforce.
Hydraulic fracturing We recognize how important it is to reassure   local communities that we™re effectively   managing the environmental impacts of our   unconventional oil and gas operations, including   water contamination, chemicals use and the   hydraulic fracturing process.
With the acquisition of BHP™s American shale  assets into BPX Energy, we™ve significantly   upgraded our US onshore gas portfolio.
We take action to minimize the environmental   impacts associated with our operations.
We design, operate and decommission our   wells in ways that reduce water contamination.
For example, we install multiple layers of steel   into each well and protect freshwater aquifers   with cement barriers.
These are all tested   before any hydraulic fracturing.
To reduce friction and bacterial growth,  chemicals are added to the water and sand   mixture that makes up 99.5% of the injection   materials we use.
We publish details of all these   chemicals, although their formulas are owned   by our suppliers.
Energy with purpose Assessing future climate risks  We™ve assessed historical and future precipitation- related ˚ood risks during the planning for a new  project at our BP Rotterdam refinery.
The new  project will result in additional paved areas and  capacity for increased storm water volume to be  managed.
Based on the results of our assessment,  the need to expand storm water pumping capacity  was highlighted.
Storm surge risk was also looked at as part of the  assessment, taking into account both existing  ˚ood protection measures and up to date storm  surge scenarios.
High resolution maps of ˚ooding  from storm surge and precipitation for a variety of  climate scenarios were developed.
The new data on precipitation and storm surge  ˚ood risks has been incorporated into the site™s  major accident hazard report for future reference.
The hydraulic fracturing process creates very  small earth tremors.
These are rarely felt at the   surface and before we start work, we assess   their likelihood.
For example, we try to identify   natural faults in rock formations, which enables   us to mitigate the risk of tremors through the   way we design operations.
59In 2019 we introduced ‚Pulse Live™,  to help monitor weekly changes in  employee sentiment.
People Why it matters Our people are the most important element of  our success.
We need a motivated, engaged,   and diverse workforce to deliver our purpose   and lead in the energy transition.
What we want to do Build a global workforce that represents the   communities we serve and be recognized as   a great company to work for: one where people   feel valued and can succeed by contributing   their skills and different perspectives.
Our approach We™re building a culture that generates the   diversity of thought, approach and ideas needed   to lead in the energy transition Œ a culture in   which people™s wellbeing matters and   differences are valued.
We™re doing this by: Ł Recruiting and supporting talented people   from diverse backgrounds Ł Investing in excellent training, development   and competitive rewards for all our people Performance Ł Part of overall reward for around 37,000   eligible employees, including executives, now   linked to sustainable emissions reductions Ł Included in the Financial Times™ Leaders in   Diversity and in The Times Top 50 Employers   for Women lists What™s next Ł An even stronger focus on inclusion to unlock   human energy and value difference across BP Ł Inclusion for all, supported by focused   activities relevant to the different countries   around the world in which we operate Œ for   example, ethnicity, LGBT+, disability and   mental wellbeing In this section Diversity and inclusion  62Engagement and development 66 Building a talent pipeline 676070,100 people working for BP in 2019 Being a responsible employer We employ more than 70,000 people.
They work in hundreds of locations worldwide.
We want our employees to work in safe, healthy,   secure and good conditions.
Respect for their   human rights is integral to our recruitment,   management and diversity and inclusion   processes.
Our employees are bound by our code of  conduct, which requires them to report any   suspected human rights abuses or incidents   of wrongdoing in BP or in our business partners™   operations, including bribery and corruption.
They can report these through their line   management, our human resources team,   or by using our independent and confidential   ‚OpenTalk™ service.
Read more about our approach to labour rights  and human rights on  page 47 .Employee safety  Our first priority is to keep our employees safe   and alert to potential hazards.
Everyone working   at BP has the responsibility and authority to   stop unsafe work or ask for clarity about things   they find unclear.
Our leaders are accountable   for helping to build this safety-first culture in   their teams and all employees are responsible   for keeping themselves and each other safe   at work.
Read more about our approach to safety on   page 39 .Energy with purpose means  having the skills and the will to  reimagine what BP can achieve BP™s success depends on having  a talented and diverse workforce   that represents the communities   we serve.
We are proud to have the   brightest minds in our industry with   a modern working environment and   an inclusive, dynamic culture.
Together   we are working to deliver our purpose   and power the energy transition.
BP and the energy industry as a whole are  undergoing a period of fundamental change Œ   driven by the demands of the energy transition.
We need to become a different kind of energy   company for a very different future.
This means   building a modern, ˚exible working environment   and an inclusive culture in which people feel   valued and able to contribute their best knowing   that BP protects their rights, works to keep   them safe and well, invests in their development   and rewards them fairly and competitively.
We™re investing time and energy to make sure  our practices and systems help us become an   employer of choice wherever we work.
61 Our UK Sunbury office is one of  the locations where our Women™s  International Network has a presence.
Our leaders are vital in instilling an inclusive  culture by showing their support and providing   strategic direction for employees to follow.
Diversity and inclusion performance in 2019 Our strategy for diversity and inclusion focuses   on unlocking human energy.
It will give us an   even sharper focus on inclusion and emphasize   the importance of recognizing and valuing   employees™ visible and invisible differences.
In 2019 we received recognition for our  progress on diversity and inclusion from  many external organizations.
Ł Included in the Financial Times™ Leaders  in Diversity at number 40 out of 700.
Ł Listed in The Times Top 50 Employers   for Women.

Diversity and inclusion We need a diverse workforce to be successful  as a company, especially as we advance in   the energy transition, to help us solve complex   challenges that matter, build long term and   trusted relationships and make a real contribution   to a low carbon future.
We want to attract, develop and retain the  best talent and to create a diverse and inclusive   working environment, where everyone is   accepted, valued and treated fairly without   discrimination.
This starts with our attraction   and recruitment processes and continues through   the way we support employees and unlock their   human energy during their time with BP.
Our approach We first set out our current diversity and   inclusion ambition in 2012.
It™s based on our   core values of safety, respect, excellence,   courage and one team.
During 2019 our overarching themes have been  ‚respect and inclusion™ and ‚valuing difference™.
Our definition of inclusion covers both visible   and invisible differences, stressing the value   of both.
These include differences in thoughts   and ideas, cultures and approaches as well as   more visible aspects.
It™s important to recognize   that people often don™t fit into only one diversity   strand but may relate to several groups or   interests.
We are building a culture that   understands this intersectionality and values   every individual™s unique and complex sense   of identity.
Equality and respect go   hand in hand.
To attract   and retain exceptional   people, BP must promote   diversity of thought and an   inclusive approach.
We will   only succeed in reimagining   energy and reinventing   BP if we recognize and   embrace these factors.ﬂ Bernard Looney Chief executive officer 62BP employees by gender in 2019 Female Male We participate in  industry mentoring   to advance gender  diversity.
All employees 38% 62% We work closely with  universities to attract  women into scientific  and engineering roles.
Graduate hires 45% 55% We support  programmes that help  women resume their  careers after a break.
Experienced hires 39% 61% We are on track for   women to represent  a quarter of our most  senior managers by  2020.
Group leaders 25% 75% The number of women   in our executive team   remained the same as   in 2018.
Executive team 15% 85% We achieved our goal   for women to represent   30% of our board.
Board of directors 42% 58% Addressing the gender balance Both the energy sector and our business have   traditionally had a gender imbalance, with more   men than women in some roles.
This is   something that we™ve been working to address   over a number of years and while we™ve made   some progress, we know there™s still further   to go to achieve a gender balance.
Overall, the proportion of women employed  across BP continues to be higher than ever   before.
38% (2018 35%) of our workforce were   women in 2019.
We™re pleased to see   improvements in areas of the company where   women were previously under-represented   and to have women leading some of our core   businesses, such as petrochemicals, shipping   and treasury, and countries including Canada,   China, Mexico and the US.
Our graduate intake   is almost balanced, with 45% women and   55% men.
In 2012 we set two 2020 gender goals: for  women to hold 25% of our group leader roles   and 30% of our senior level leader roles.
Our   group leaders were 25% women at the end   of 2019, compared to 17% when we first   reported on this in 2012 (an increase of 47%).
We™re still short of our 30% goal for senior level   leaders, at 26% in 2019, so we remain focused   on this.
We consider sponsorship and mentoring of   women to be key ways of supporting our   leadership talent pipeline.
We™re also doing   more to include men in our efforts to achieve   a better gender balance to seek to ensure   everyone feels included.
UK gender pay gap reporting  We make sure that employees in similar roles   are paid equitably, and in the UK we publish a   pay gap report for five BP UK legal entities that   employ 250 or more people.
This gender pay   gap shows the difference in average pay between   men and women, irrespective of their roles.
Our 2019 report, the third to be published,  shows small improvements compared to 2018,   including improvements in our highest pay gap   entities, BP Exploration Operating Company   Limited and BP p.l.c.
The mean gender pay gap   remained reasonably static from 2018-19,   changing between 1-3% in each of the   reporting entities.
Our gender pay gap exists mainly because we  employ different numbers of men and women   at different levels in our workforce, and in specific   roles that attract higher pay, bonuses or allowances.
We are working to reduce differences over  time and recognize that this is a long-term   representation challenge we need to address.
See  bp.com/ukgenderpaygap  for more information  on our UK gender pay gap reporting.
38% women in our workforce in 2019 Œ  higher than ever before 63Our accessibility BRGs aim to break  down barriers related to long-term  illnesses, injuries and disabilities.
22% of our leaders in the US are from ethnic  minorities, with 25% targeted   by 2050 Accessibility We want to create a working environment in   which everyone can perform to their maximum   potential, irrespective of any disabilities they   may have.
We recognize the importance of   accessibility for all and we take action through   our employee-led accessibility business   resource group (BRG) to get this right.
This   group works to help us raise awareness, break   down mental or physical barriers and improve   access to work.
It also helps BP to consider   how to improve our support for accessibility.
The accessibility BRG has executive sponsors  for each region it works in, raising the prominence   of accessibility issues at a senior level.
Members   of the BRG are also included in discussions about   how BP can support accessibility better.
In 2019 we made good progress, extending our  accessibility BRG to new countries in EMEA,   Asia Pacific and US regions and improving the   accessibility of our UK sites to all employees.
We formed a mental wellbeing network and   further highlighted mental health issues through   BP™s global ‚this is me™ awareness campaign, in   which our new chief executive officer   participated.
In addition, we extended the availability of  employee assistance programmes globally and   integrated some of our training programmes to   improve mental health and wellbeing through   the BP learning academy.
We also ran an   internal awareness-raising feature and events   for our employees to support the 2019   International Day of Personal Disabilities.
Ethnicity  In the US we aim to have ethnic minorities   making up 20% of our group and senior level   leaders and 30% of our workforce by 2025.
We reached 22% (2018 18%) for our leaders   and 28% (2018 27%) for our workforce in 2019.
Our recruitment, development, promotion and   inclusion programmes in the US underpin these   ambitions.
For example, we™ve recently launched   our ‚minority rules of the road™, a set of principles   that focus on ethnic diversity of candidates.
In the UK, EMEA and other regions, although  we haven™t set any specific ambitions for ethnic   and minority representation, we recognize that   it™s an important issue.
We™ve conducted research   to help us understand more about our black,   Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) employees   in the UK and assess their grades and progress   through the company.
At present in the UK,   ethnic minorities make up 17% of our employees,   compared to an estimated 14% of the UK   working population.
In the UK we™ve also received external  recognition for our work on ethnicity in 2019.
For the third consecutive year BP leaders have   been recognized in the ‚EMpower Ethnic   Minority Role Model™ lists for their contribution   to ethnic minority inclusion in and outside of   the workplace.
We were also included in the   Top 10 Outstanding Employees in the 2018   Investing in Ethnicity Awards and Business in   the Community™s Best Employers for Race listing.
Employing nationals In many of the countries where we operate,   we provide significant employment opportunities.
Many of these opportunities are taken by   nationals, who can balance our international   expertise with their experience of local conditions   and cultures.
We recruit them and invest in their   training and development whether or not host   governments require us to do so.
Across BP as a whole, 25% of our global  leaders are non-US or non-UK nationals.
In the upstream we™re making progress on   employee nationalization with goals of up to   90% in many countries.
64Business resource groups Our business resource groups (BRGs) offer  support and advice to employees about   diversity and inclusion.
They also provide   peer support and opportunities for group   members to discuss workplace issues as   well as leadership exposure and experience   for their BRG leaders and teams.
The BRGs   contribute to our business policies and   practices, providing valuable insights for   managers and leaders at all levels.
There are six BRGs with more than 20 chapters  in the UK and another 20 across EMEA.
They   represent a wide range of communities,   including ethnic minorities, women, LGBT+,   people with disabilities, and new parents   and carers.
The reach and impact of our BRGs is growing  well beyond our established groups in the   UK and US.
BRGs are now also active in   Hungary, Spain, Poland, Oman, Abu Dhabi,   Egypt, Singapore, China and Japan.
In 2019   we™ve built closer ties between our central   diversity and inclusion team and local BRGs.
We also encourage cross-BRG activities,   allowing people to understand differences   and support others.
In 2019 we invited employees from our  BRGs to come together through a number   of events and activities: Ł A webcast to around 1,000 employees   on the economics of diversity arranged by   UK Positively Ethnic Network (PEN) and   US African American Network (BPAAN).
Ł A ‚big conversation™ about the value of   diversity at our Sunbury site in the UK   featured a panel of guests from Global   WIN, PEN and Pride UK.
Ł A diversity and inclusion week in the   Netherlands, co-facilitated by our BP Pride   UK chair, showcased all our BRGs and   what they offer.
Ł A BRG roadshow and panel discussion   with our integrated supply and trading   team including contributors from our WIN,   accessibility, PEN, Pride, working parents   and carers, and veterans BRGs.
Ł A BRG summit in the US to share   experience and best practice.
We plan   to run a similar event in the UK in 2020.
Energy with purpose Supporting transgender people  through BP Pride The BP Pride BRG has supported employees  across BP for around 10 years, but it wasn™t  until 2016 that it launched a transgender group.
The decision to do this was a result of feedback  from that year™s BP ‚pulse™ survey, which showed  that transgender people working for BP were  feeling disengaged.
BP Pride supports all of our employees on lesbian,  gay, bisexual and transgender issues in the   workplace and actively aids and pushes the  business to enhance policies that support our  LGBT+ community.
In November 2019 its members,  including those on the transgender working group,  were first movers in the creation of a unique event  called ‚Trans in the City™ which brought together  65 organizations to participate in a transgender   day of remembrance and collaborative advocacy  for transgender employees.
BP was proud to  be involved as one of 20 funding partners of the event.
Throughout 2019, the transgender working group   instigated and participated in a number of  initiatives, including: transgender awareness  events at BP sites across the UK, transgender  training for BP employees in a number of different  countries, personal support and advice for BP™s  trans individuals and family members and a  number of cross-BRG events, including one   focused on transgender and family.
The working  group offers its knowledge and advice free of  charge beyond BP and in 2019 participants from  companies worldwide took part in transgender- focused training sessions.
Many others benefited  from other forms of support, including individual  role models from different organizations.
In addition to internal activities, BP Pride is leading  the expansion of ‚Trans in the City™ to involve more  companies.
In 2020 there are plans for a daytime  event open to schools and universities as well as  an evening celebration.
We will collaborate and  share information with employees from the  participating companies to allow their trans staff  to be properly supported.
65We provide employees with varied  on-the-job learning and training.
Making progress toward our strategic priorities  accounts for 20% of the longer-term share   awards of our chief executive officer and chief   financial officer.
Many performance measures,   including those related to gas, renewables,   venturing and renewables trading, contribute to this.

Employees can   contact the EAP to discuss anything that may   be worrying them, including financial difficulties   or significant life events such as illness,   bereavement or divorce.
We know that one in four people are affected  by mental health issues at some point in their   life, so we run a number of awareness   campaigns, including ‚this is me™, which enables   employees from all parts and levels of BP to   share their experiences of mental illness.
In   2019 we took part in World Mental Health Day.
Read more about how we support employees™  health and wellbeing on  page 39 .Flexible working  As part of our work to modernize and transform   BP, we™re doing more to embrace ˚exible   working Œ allowing employees to find a better   work-life balance and work more productively.
We™ve refreshed and launched our global   ˚exible working principles and reviewed our   leave allowances, providing every employee   with a minimum amount of paid parental or   carer leave.
Engagement and   development We aim to create a positive, empowering   culture by listening and responding to our   employees™ concerns and ideas.
We want our   employees to feel valued for their work and   impact on the business, rewarding them fairly   and competitively, supporting their health and   wellbeing, and investing in their development.
Reward It™s important to reward our employees   competitively for the great work they do.
We think that reward is about more than just   pay Œ it should also include a range of benefits   and the opportunity to work and learn in an   inclusive and supportive environment.
Our reward package is based on employee  performance, including operating in line with   our core values.
Every BP employee sets   priorities for their contribution to safety and   creating value.
In 2019 we changed our annual   cash bonus, linking it directly to our sustainable   emissions reduction (SER) target.
This means   that for around 37,000 eligible employees,   including executives, part of their overall reward   is now linked directly to meeting our low carbon   emissions targets.
In February 2020 we built   on this, announcing a new aim to mobilize our   workforce to be advocates for net zero.
This   includes increasing the percentage of   remuneration linked to SERs.
Our executive pay is also linked to performance,  with safety, reliable operations and financial   performance accounting for one-third of   executive bonuses.
Tier 1 and tier 2 process   safety events and recordable injury frequency   are the safety performance measures we use   for executive reward.
In 2019 more of our employees have found   ways of working ˚exibly, for example by   combining home and office time.
In the UK   a number of teams embraced ˚exible working,   while in Hungary, our Budapest and Szeged   offices have used a ˚exible working model   to optimize available space.
At our Houston   office in the US, new ways of working remotely   were required when the office had to shut   temporarily due to hurricane Harvey.
They   proved so successful that some teams have   continued these new practices.
Development We make a substantial investment in employee   development Œ with a focus on driving safe,   reliable and compliant operations, and on   building technical, functional and leadership   capability.
We provide a range of development   opportunities for our people through a mix of:   on-the-job learning; developmental relationships   with mentors, managers and peers; and training   delivered face-to-face, virtually and via simulation   or e-learning.
Leadership training Succession planning is important to BP.
We must   make sure we have the right people progressing   through our company to become our future   leaders.
One of the ways we™re doing this is   through the ‚your leadership: our future™   programme, which is designed to equip potential   leaders in our Upstream business with the skills   they will need to excel in leadership roles.
In August 2019 we launched ‚accelerate™,  a global programme to support employees   as they transition into leadership roles.
The   three-month accelerate curriculum covers   everything from motivating teams to health   and wellbeing.
More than 1,000 employees   have participated in the programme since it   was launched.
In September 2019 we launched   ‚mentor match™, a one-year programme that is   now providing one-to-one mentoring for almost   300 high-potential employees.
66 We run three other talent-development  programmes for high-potential employees   and future leaders.
The ‚aspire™ programme   focuses on building partnership and   leadership skills.
It had 76 participants in   24 BP locations in 2019.
The ‚catalyst™   programme comprises stretching strategic   projects designed to energize and engage   employees, particularly those based outside   key locations.
It was completed by 80   employees in 2019.
The ‚leadership insights™   programme helps prepare employees for   future leadership roles and was completed   by 43 participants in 2019.
Learning from our employees To understand what our employees think   and feel about BP, we run an annual ‚Pulse™   survey.
The overall employee engagement   positivity score in our 2019 survey was 65%   (compared with 66% in 2018).
Pride in   working for BP was 75% (compared with   76% in 2018, the highest level for 10 years).
In the 2019 survey participating employees told  us we should focus more attention in several   areas, including: sharing our strategy, reinforcing   the need for an open speak-up culture, explaining   how BP is taking action to help create a low   carbon future and providing updates on safety   improvements and other priorities.
We also launched our continuous listening  survey ‚Pulse Live™ to parts of BP in 2019,   which enables us to monitor changes in   employee sentiment on a weekly basis.
We plan to roll out ‚Pulse Live™ across the   whole organization in 2020.
Building a talent pipeline We need to attract, recruit and retain   talented people in all areas of our company.
This is a key challenge for us and our peers,   with fewer young people currently choosing   careers in science, technology, engineering   and maths (STEM) fields.
We currently support initiatives around the  world to encourage students to study STEM   subjects and then choose careers in linked   fields.
We™re working in collaboration with   others, for example the Royal Academy of   Engineering in the UK and are involved in   many different initiatives.
These include   POWERful Women and Million Women   Mentors, which both focus on bringing more   women into STEM disciplines and professions.
As part of the Women in Engineering conference,  launched by the University of Aberdeen and Skills  Development Scotland, girls from schools across  the UK also visited the BP North Sea headquarters.
We also created new teaching resources to showcase  inspirational women working in STEM careers.
These activities were run in addition to our ongoing  efforts to promote STEM disciplines and careers.
They include speed networking, mentoring, an   active school link and our support for the Royal  Academy of Engineering™s 6 November campaign  to change stereotypical views of engineering.
Energy with purpose Encouraging more women to work  in engineering The UK currently has an engineering skills gap.
To help address this and encourage more women  into engineering we ran a number of events  during 2019.
For International Women in Engineering day,  we invited girls and young women from local  schools to learn about different engineering  roles and meet career role models at our  Sunbury site in the UK.
A separate ‚this is   engineering™ event at Sunbury was attended  by 130 students.
Sunbury also hosted a  ‚women in tech™ day for 20 girls.

Business ethics Why it matters To be a trusted business, we must work to a  consistent and high set of standards wherever   we operate in the world.
What we want to do Be and be seen as an ethical and responsible   business, setting high standards inside BP,   in our supply chain and in the industry.
Our approach We do business in line with our code of   conduct, values and behaviours, policies and   procedures relating to all aspect of ethical   business, including bribery and corruption,   supply chain standards and revenue transparency.
Performance  Ł Continued to promote revenue transparency   through multi-stakeholder groups in   Mauritania, Iraq and Trinidad & Tobago Ł Successful conclusion of the five-year ethics   ‚monitorship™ put in place following the   Gulf of Mexico incident to build and embed   best-in-class ethics programmes across BP What™s next Reinforcing our code of conduct, values and   behaviours while continuing to support strong   business ethics and a positive culture.
In this section Anti-bribery and corruption 69Responsible supply chain management 70Revenue transparency and payments  to governments 71Political donations 71Advocacy and lobbying 71Trade associations 7168~11,000 employees completed anti-bribery   and corruption training in 2019 Anti-bribery and corruption We operate in parts of the world where bribery  and corruption present a high risk, so it™s   important that we make our position regarding   both absolutely clear to our employees, contractors,   suppliers and others in any way connected to   our business.
Our code of conduct explicitly prohibits  engaging in bribery or corruption in any form.
Our group-wide anti-bribery and corruption   policy and procedures include measures and   guidance to assess risks, understand relevant   laws and report concerns.
They apply to all   BP-operated businesses.
Appropriate training is   focused on the needs of employees in locations   or roles assessed to be at a higher risk of   bribery and corruption.
In 2019 around 11,000   (2018 10,957) employees completed anti-bribery   and corruption training.
We assess any exposure to bribery and corruption  risk when working with suppliers and business   partners.
When appropriate, we put in place a   risk mitigation plan and will choose not to work   with a counterparty or reject tenders if we   conclude that the risks are too high.
We also   conduct anti-bribery compliance audits on   selected suppliers when contracts are in place.
For example, our Upstream business conducts   a number of supplier audits in regions where   we operate, to assess their conformance with   our anti-bribery and corruption contractual   requirements.
We take corrective action with   suppliers and business partners who fail to meet   our expectations, which may include terminating   contracts.
We issued 25 audit reports in 2019   (compared with 27 in 2018).
We also support anti-corruption efforts through  our active participation in the Extractive Industries   Transparency Initiative (EITI).
The EITI provides   a global framework for transparency of payments   to government.
Through the disclosure of   government revenues and other relevant   information (such as the beneficial owners of   extractive companies and the contracts that   govern upstream activity), EITI can help to   mitigate corruption risks in the extractive sector   and support local anti-corruption efforts.
Energy with purpose means  being a business that™s trusted  and transparent We™re committed to doing business  ethically and transparently, using   our values and our code of conduct   to guide us.
We expect our employees   to work in line with both and to   treat others with respect, fairness   and dignity.
Our code of conduct sets clear expectations  for how we work at BP.
It applies to all our   employees and members of the board.
We train   BP employees about how to apply the code in   their daily work and in 2019 this training focused   on employees sharing stories about how the   code and values have helped guide their actions   in difficult situations.
The training is available in   18 languages and in 2019 around 39,000   employees completed it in full.
We also provide   respect and harassment prevention training to   help employees and line managers understand   their roles in creating a harassment-free   work environment.
Our expectations of suppliers are documented  in order to help them develop and strengthen   their relationships with us by acting in accordance   with the code.
Read our expectations at   bp.com/supplierexpectations .The five-year ethics monitorship put in place   following the Gulf of Mexico incident, under   the US Environmental Protection Agency and   Department of Justice agreements, ended in   2019.
This has overseen the development of   a strong ethics and compliance programme   across BP, as well as making ethics and   compliance liaison employees (ambassadors)   the interface between ethics and compliance   and our businesses.
69Responsible supply  chain management We seek to manage environmental, social and   economic impacts throughout our supply chains.
The scale and complexity of our supply chains  result in a range of risks and opportunities that   need to be managed actively and responsibly.
To provide some idea of the scale of this   challenge, we currently operate in over 70   countries and have around 50,000 suppliers.
These include contractors, vendors, service   providers and contingent labour, many of   whom also have further suppliers.
Including trading operations, our annual  procurement spend is approximately $59 billion   (2018 $67 billion).
Given the substantial contribution they make  to our activities, BP suppliers and contractors   play an important part in implementing our   strategy to be a strong, successful business and   responsible corporate citizen.
We engage with   our suppliers and contractors to communicate   our standards and encourage improved ethical   and sustainability performance in our supply   chains.
Whenever possible, we use contracts   to help ensure this is the case, for example by   requiring contractors to meet local workforce   requirements for nationals or to support local   enterprise.
We aim to work with suppliers who strive for  sustainability in their supply chains and innovation   and excellence in the delivery of products or   services, working in accordance with our code   of conduct, human rights policy and other   expectations of suppliers.
These are set out in   our supplier expectations document.
Our new   labour rights and modern slavery principles   are also available to assist our businesses in   checking suppliers™ performance on these aspects.
Concerns and enquiries raised through all reporting channels in 2019 (by code of conduct chapter)Operating safely, responsibly and reliably 243Governments and communities 75Our people 865Our assets and financial integrity 393Our business partners 204Other matters 69Speaking up We want our employees, contractors, vendors,  third parties and other stakeholders to feel   comfortable about speaking up whenever they   have a question or concern about our code, or   if they see something that they feel is unethical   or unsafe.
Concerns and enquiries can be raised   through multiple channels: with line managers   or other senior leaders, supporting teams,   including human resources, legal, ethics   and compliance and through work councils.
Concerns can also be raised anonymously via   OpenTalk, the BP global confidential helpline.
This is administered by an independent company   and is available 24 hours a day, seven days a   week.
It can accommodate calls in more than   75 languages by phone or web.
We received more than 1,800 concerns a or  enquiries through these channels in 2019.
The  most commonly raised concerns were related   to the ‚our people™ section of our code.
This   section addresses issues such as harassment,   equal opportunity, and diversity and inclusion.
We have zero tolerance for retaliation against  anyone who seeks advice, raises a concern,   reports misconduct or participates in an   investigation.
The consequences for misconduct,   code breaches or violations of our values and   behaviours range from coaching to dismissal.
In 2019 there were over 100 separations b for  non-conformance with our code of conduct   or unethical behaviour.
This total excludes   dismissals of staff employed at our retail   service stations.
Our standard procurement contracts include   a requirement for suppliers to respect   internationally recognized human rights,   and specifically exclude employing, engaging,   or otherwise using forced labour, trafficked   labour or exploitative child labour.
Focusing our   efforts on where we believe risks are higher,   our labour rights due diligence process helps us   to identify risks and potential adverse impacts   on the rights of workers in our supply chain.
We use this process to assess suppliers on   a risk-prioritized basis.
We take a systematic   approach to assessing the risk of modern slavery   by building assessment into our management   systems, processes and procedures.
We are working with a number of our peers  to create an oil and gas industry platform for   supplier human rights assessments, with a   particular focus on labour rights.
When developed   it™s intended that the results of assessments using   this approach can be shared with the participating   companies through an independent third party.
The aim is to make it easier and more efficient   for suppliers to demonstrate how they respect   human rights and support improvements in   working conditions.
In 2019 we appointed a   third-party consultancy, NOROG, to manage the   tendering process for expert providers of supplier   human rights due diligence and audits.

Total number of concerns and enquiries raised201720182019 OpenTalkRaised with management1,8001,200600070Political donations We prohibit the use of BP funds or resources  to support any political candidate or party.
We recognize the rights of our employees to   participate in the political process and these   rights are governed by the applicable laws in   the countries where we operate.
In the US we provide administrative support for  the BP employee political action committee   (PAC), which is a non-partisan committee that   encourages voluntary employee participation   in the political process.
All BP employee PAC   contributions are reviewed for compliance with   federal and state law and are publicly reported   in accordance with US election laws.
Advocacy and lobbying We co-operate and engage with governments,   regulators and legislators in the development of   proposed policies relevant to our business.
These   policies can affect us in a wide range of areas   Œ from tax and employment issues to safety or   the energy transition.
This co-operation and   engagement may include direct lobbying on   specific policy proposals by our own employees,   through broader advocacy via research work or   supporting think tanks, to communications   activities and advertising.
For example, we are   working with Washington state legislature in   support of a cap-and-invest bill for GHG emissions.
Read more about our advocacy on carbon pricing  on  page 19 .
We make disclosures under the relevant   legislation within the jurisdictions in which we   operate.
For example, BP is registered on the   Transparency Register of the European Union   and we comply with the US Lobbying   Disclosure Act (LDA).
Trade associations  BP is a member of many industry associations   that offer opportunities to share good practices   and collaborate on issues of importance to our   sector.
We aim for alignment between our   policies and those of trade associations but   understand that associations™ positions re˚ect   a compromise of the assorted views of the   membership.
In February 2020 we announced   our aim to set new expectations for our   relationships with trade associations around the   globe.
We will make the case for our views on   climate change and we™ll be transparent where   we differ.
And where we can™t reach alignment,   we will be prepared to leave.

BP launched the programme   along with the Senegalese National Institute   of Oil and Gas in October 2019.
The workshops   aim to train more than 3,000 participants over   a one-year period, focusing on oil and gas   fundamentals and legal, institutional and fiscal   aspects of oil and gas.
The course will be   delivered to a range of stakeholders from   media, civil society, private sector, universities,   public administration and parliamentarians.
Our approach to tax We comply with tax laws and have open and   constructive relationships with tax authorities.
We participate in initiatives to simplify and  improve tax regimes to encourage investment   and economic growth.
Our approach to tax   aligns with our code of conduct, which sets out   what is expected of everyone at BP.
This includes   acting in a manner that is safe, ethical and   consistent with applicable laws and regulations.
We do not tolerate the facilitation of tax evasion   by people who act for or on behalf of BP.
You can read  Our approach to tax  and  Payments to governments  reports at  bp.com/revenuetransparency .Revenue transparency and  payments to governments We support transparency in the ˚ow of revenue   from our oil and gas activities to governments.
This helps citizens hold public authorities to   account for the way they use funds received   through taxes and other agreements.
BP is a founding member of the Extractive  Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which   supports the disclosure of payments made to   and received by governments in relation to oil,   gas and mining.
Through EITI we work with governments, NGOs  and international agencies to improve transparency.
For example, in 2019 we enacted our global   commitment through membership of the   international board, including supporting decision   making on the new global EITI standard, which   represents a further evolution in transparency.
The   focus is on making disclosure and open data routine   parts of government and corporate reporting,   providing information to stakeholders that supports   their widespread use in analysis and decision   making.
It now requires contract transparency for   new contracts from 2021, plus new requirements   on environmental reporting and gender.
This year, we also participated in the multi- stakeholder groups in Mauritania, Iraq and   Trinidad & Tobago and agreed to join the   multi-stakeholder group in Senegal, pending final   agreement with the National Committee there.
We disclose information on our payments to  governments for our upstream activities on   a country-by-country and project basis under   national reporting regulations.
With our presence in Mauritania and Senegal  we launched a programme of capacity-building   workshops, helping to promote transparency   and local participation in the newly created  Energy with purpose Our participation in trade associations We believe our membership of trade associations can  provide significant benefits Œ from contributing to the  development of equipment or operating and safety  standards, through to working with regulators,  knowledge sharing and professional development.
Some trade associations engage in lobbying and  advocacy on matters that they consider to be  important to their members.
Our priority is to work to in˚uence within trade  associations, but we may publicly dissent or resign  our membership if there is material misalignment on  issues that we consider high priority.
In 2019 we conducted our first group-wide review of  climate policy alignment with a number of the trade  associations that we™re members of, selecting 30 that  are actively involved in the climate debate and most  relevant to our stakeholders.
These were concentrated  in North America, Europe and Australia.
We found  that 22 aligned, five partially aligned and three did  not align.
We communicated the outcome of this review and  our expectations to all the associations we reviewed  and we™re leaving the three associations that did   not align with our position.
We plan to undertake  another review in around two-years™ time.

Governance We aim to be increasingly  transparent about the ways we   manage environmental, social and   governance issues across our business.
Our reporting, governance structure   and management processes provide   us with the foundations for achieving   greater transparency.
Having the right leadership and governance  structure in place is crucial to our ability to   deliver our strategy, purpose and new net zero   ambition and aims.
This structure, which includes   the board and its committees, extends through   the organization via the executive leadership   and our senior leaders to all employees.
In this section Human rights governance 74Executive oversight of sustainability 74Managing risks 7572 Aberdeen Following the AGM in Aberdeen, the board held  a number of engagement activities.
Helge Lund  and Bob Dudley led a town hall which was  attended by over 300 employees at BP™s Dyce  office and was streamed live to the offshore  teams in the North Sea.
The board hosted a  business reception, inviting members of the  local community, local political and government   officials, employees and local businesses.
Members of the board had further engagement  with the workforce at the Dyce office, observing  new agile ways of working and gaining technological  insight into new initiatives.
Members of the  board also visited the Clair Ridge platform,  where they learnt more about operations   offshore.
They discussed the safety agenda  onsite, visited the drilling ˚oor and spoke with  employees directly to better understand the  culture when working offshore.
South Korea SESAC visited BP™s shipping function and spent  a day at sea in South Korea on board a new LNG  vessel.
They experienced the vessel in a period  of ‚shakedown™ ahead of going into service.
The  committee observed safety processes in action  and were able to discuss physical and cyber  security planning.
Members of SESAC met with  seafarers without management present to   discuss life working on board the vessels.
Site visits In 2019 members of the board and SESAC  visited our operations in several countries   to give them first-hand experience of our   assets and to observe and ask questions.
Energy with purpose means   minimizing risk and   maximizing efficiency The board is responsible for the  overall conduct of the group™s   business, including oversight of   our strategy and approach to the   energy transition.
It reviews and   monitors performance against our   strategy and low carbon ambitions   and confirms that the processes for   identifying and managing key risks,   both financial and non-financial,   are in place.
Board oversight of sustainability matters The safety, environment, and security assurance   committee (SESAC), one of our six board   committees, reviews the processes that our   executive team use to identify and mitigate   operational and non-financial risk, including   marine, wells, pipelines, major security incidents   and cyber security.
The committee works with   the executive leadership team to embed safe   and reliable operations.
In 2019 SESAC held six meetings.
The topics it  discussed included the sustainability report and   BP™s working practices in relation to modern   slavery and related human rights.
Read more about SESAC in the  BP Annual Report 2019  page 96 .Kuala Lumpur and Singapore Members of the audit committee visited the  global business services office in Kuala Lumpur.
Touring BP™s offices gave valuable insight into  the workforce which has been responsible for  centralizing and standardizing key business  processes across the organization and transforming  processes end-to-end.
The directors then  visited the integrated supply and trading team in   Singapore where they met with senior leadership  and the wider workforce at BP™s offices.
Denver The board visited BP™s Denver office in  September 2019 where they hosted several  employee events.
A town hall took place, led by  Helge Lund, with the rest of the board present  to talk with the workforce and answer questions  over a community lunch, with over 150  employees in attendance.
The board were also  introduced to emerging talent in the region and   met with senior leadership.
As part of the suite  of events the board also met external  stakeholders at a business reception in the city.
73Executive oversight of  sustainability  The assessment and management of climate-  related issues are embedded in BP at various   levels, with delegated authority from the board.
The executive team discussed climate-related   matters at each of its 11 meetings in 2019,   including the development of BP™s net zero   ambition and aims before these were presented   to the board.
The executive team is supported   by our senior level leaders and their respective   teams, which provided dedicated business and   functional expertise focused on climate and   related areas.
They include our carbon   management team, safety and operational risk   teams, economics team and group policy.
We foster close alignment between group,  business and function leaders through a number   of bodies and forums, including carbon steering   committees for group, upstream and downstream.
Human rights governance SESAC has oversight of human rights, including   reviewing our performance in assessing and   managing risks associated with modern slavery.
The group operations risk committee reviews  progress on managing the potential risks of   modern slavery.
Our human rights working group, which is made  up of representatives from across the business,   considers current and emerging human rights   risks of potential group significance.
The group   reviews existing and proposed management of   such risks and escalates identified human rights   risks to executive team level as necessary.
Business functions and local operations are  responsible for implementing actions to help us   meet our human rights policy commitments and   relevant group requirements, such as providing   channels for local communities to raise concerns.

In 2019   these were: financial liquidity, geopolitical risk,   cyber security, process safety, personal safety   and environmental risks, security, ethical   misconduct, legal and regulatory compliance,   and trading compliance.
The oversight and management of other risks,  for example technological change, is undertaken   in the normal course of business.
See How we manage risk in the   BP Annual Report 2019  page 68 .
Managing risks in our operations  Our operating businesses are responsible for   identifying and managing risks and our operating   management system (OMS) helps them do this   in a consistent and rigorous way.
Our OMS brings together BP requirements on  health, safety, security, the environment, social   responsibility and operational reliability Œ as well   as related issues, such as maintenance, contractor   relations and organizational learning Œ into a   common management system.
Any variations in the application of our OMS, in  order to meet local regulations or circumstances,   are subject to a governance process.
Setting out our expectations  We often work with other companies in our   joint ventures.
Sometimes we are the operator   and sometimes another party manages the   operations.
We monitor performance and how   risk is managed in our joint ventures, whether   we are the operator or not.
In joint ventures   where we are the operator, our OMS, code   of conduct and other policies apply.
We aim to report on aspects of our business  where we are the operator as we directly   manage the performance of these operations.
Where we are not the operator, our OMS is   available as a reference point for BP businesses   when engaging with operators and co-venturers.
We have a group framework to assess and   manage BP™s exposure related to safety,   operational, and bribery and corruption risk from   our participation in non-operated joint ventures.
Where appropriate, we may seek to in˚uence   how risk is managed in these types of ventures.
Assessing physical risks to our facilities  We seek to assess the potential impacts of   severe weather events and a changing climate   Œ such as heatwaves, extreme precipitation,   drought, storms and rising sea levels Œ on our   new projects from the design stage.
Our   operations and projects can draw on guidance,   including in-house expertise, to help them   manage potential risks from a changing climate.
We are working with industry and academia   to build enhanced tools and methods to help   assess potential changes.
We™re also working with industry peers through  the International Association of Oil & Gas   Producers (IOGP).
In 2019 we contributed to   several IOGP initiatives linked to climate change   adaptation.
We produced a draft guidance note   on climate change which aims to provide current   best practice for metocean (a term used in the   offshore industry to describe the physical   environment) practitioners.
We plan to develop   this further through a series of working sessions   with other operators and hope to publish it in late   2020.
In September 2019 we hosted a seminar in   London on ‚severe weather from extra-tropical   cyclones™, which was attended by around 50   participants, including oil and gas operators,   consultants and academics.
In November 2019,   a representative from BP ran a series of talks on   IOGP activities and the latest consensus on   severe weather risk across our industry.
Read more about climate change adaptation  on  page 59 .Our operating businesses  are responsible for   identifying and managing   risks, and our operating   management system helps   them do this in a consistent   and rigorous way.

bp.com/esgdata .Our reporting centre Brings together all our key reports, including  our annual report, as well as other reports  mentioned here.
bp.com/reportingcentre .Our reporting This Sustainability Report  concentrates on performance   and activities from 1 January   to 31 December 2019.
We aim to report on all aspects of our business,  including joint ventures where we are the   operator.
In some cases, we may also provide   information about some of our joint venture   activities where we are not the operator.
Reporting standards We use sustainability reporting guidance from   IPIECA for environmental and social issues and   report in accordance with the core option of the   Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards.
We are a signatory to the UN Global Compact  and support the UN™s 10 principles on human   rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.
This sustainability report comprises our annual   update on progress.
See  bp.com/reportingstandards  for our mapping  to selected sustainability frameworks and standards.
Environmental, social and governance data  Reporting on ESG data is an important element   of our approach.
We provide performance data   online and through our HSE charting tool.
You   can read more online at  bp.com/reportingcentre.
The data we report is subjected to an internal  verification process which includes reviews by   subject matter experts across the business.
In addition, we ask Deloitte to assure several  key sustainability metrics to the internationally   recognized ISAE 3000 standard.
You can read   more about the scope of Deloitte™s work,   including the sustainability metrics they have   assured, overleaf on page 77.
For more information about the sustainability  metrics we assure, read our basis of reporting  at  bp.com/basisofreporting .76Independent assurance  statement by Deloitte LLP to BP on selected sustainability   information Scope of work We have provided independent limited assurance,   in accordance with the International Standard   for Assurance Engagements (ﬁISAEﬂ) 3000   (Revised) a, on selected sustainability  information (ﬁsubject matterﬂ), for the financial   year ended 31 December 2019.
The subject   matter is reported in the 2019 Sustainability   Report (ﬁSRﬂ), the 2019 Annual Report and   Accounts (ﬁARAﬂ) of BP p.l.c.
(ﬁBPﬂ), and in   the ‚ESG data™ document, published on the   BP website ( BP.com ) (together, the ﬁ2019  BP Reportingﬂ).
Selected subject matter for assurance bŁ Safety indicators c: recordable injury frequency,  day away from work case frequency, number  of fatalities, number of oil spills, process   safety events (Tier 1 and Tier 2), Ł Environmental indicators: operational   control-based Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG)   emissions, equity-based Scope 1 GHG   emissions, cumulative total sustainable GHG   emissions reductions towards 3.5MteCO 2e target, and methane emissions intensity,  Ł Product emissions indicators: Carbon   intensity of marketed energy products,   Carbon intensity of refined products, Carbon   intensity of gas products, Carbon intensity of   power products, Carbon intensity of bio-power   products, Carbon emissions of marketed   energy products, and Carbon emissions   of upstream energy products.
The above subject matter has been assessed   against BP™s Reporting Requirements and   Definitions.
dKey assurance procedures  To form our conclusions, we undertook the   following procedures: Ł Examined the documents relating to BP™s   sustainability performance, including safety   and operational risk documentation, internal   audit outputs, and board committee minutes,  to understand the level of management  awareness and oversight of sustainability   performance; Ł Interviewed staff responsible for managing   data processes and data management   systems at group level; Ł Examined a sample of control documentation   for non-financial management information; Ł Examined disaggregated data reported by a   sample of businesses to assess whether the   data have been collected, consolidated and   reported accurately; and Ł Performed procedures over the completeness   of the data and whether the subject matter   data has been collected, consolidated and   reported accurately at group level.
We believe that the evidence obtained is   sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis   for our limited assurance conclusion.
Our conclusion Based on our procedures described in this   report, nothing has come to our attention that   causes us to believe that the selected subject   matter stated above presented in the 2019   BP Reporting, for the financial year ended   31 December 2019 has not been prepared,   in all material respects, in accordance with   BP™s Reporting Requirements and Definitions.
The basis of our work and level of assurance We conducted our limited assurance work in   accordance with ISAE 3000.
To achieve this,   the ISAE 3000 requires that we review the   processes, systems and competencies used   to compile the areas on which we provide   assurance.
This is designed to give a similar   level of assurance to that obtained in the review   of interim financial information.
It does not   include detailed testing of source data or the   operating effectiveness of processes and   internal controls.
Inherent limitations Inherent limitations exist in all assurance   engagements due to the selective enquiry   of the information being examined.
Therefore   fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and   not be detected.
Additionally, non-financial   information, such as that included in the 2019   BP Reporting, is subject to more inherent   limitations than financial information, given   the nature and methods used for determining,   calculating, and sampling or estimating   such information.
Our work has been undertaken so that we  might state to BP those matters we are required   to in this report and for no other purpose.
Our work did not include physical inspections   of any of BP™s operating assets.
While we acknowledge that this report will be  published on the BP website, the maintenance   and integrity of that website is the responsibility   of BP.
The work that we carried out does not  involve consideration of the maintenance and   integrity of that website and, accordingly, we   accept no responsibility for any changes that   may have occurred to this report and the 2019   BP Reporting, since they were initially   presented on the website.
Our independence and competence We complied with Deloitte™s independence   policies, which address and, in certain cases,   exceed the requirements of the International   Ethics Standards Board for Accountants™ Code   of Ethics for Professional Accountants in their   role as independent auditors, and in particular   preclude us from taking financial, commercial,   governance and ownership positions which   might affect, or be perceived to affect, our   independence and impartiality, and from any   involvement in the preparation of the report.
We have confirmed to BP that we have  maintained our independence and objectivity   throughout the year and that there were no   events or prohibited services provided which   could impair our independence and objectivity.
We have applied the International Standard  on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintain   a comprehensive system of quality control   including documented policies and procedures   regarding compliance with ethical requirements,   professional standards and applicable legal and   regulatory requirements.
Roles and responsibilities BP is responsible for the preparation of the   sustainability information and statements   contained within the 2019 BP Reporting.
It is   responsible for selecting appropriate KPIs with   which to describe the entity™s performance,   and establishing and maintaining appropriate   performance management and internal control   systems from which the reported information   is derived.
Our responsibility is to independently express  conclusions on the subject matter as defined   within the scope of work above to BP in   accordance with our letter of engagement.
Our work has been undertaken so that we may   notify BP of those matters we are required to   inform them of in this statement and for no   other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by   law, we do not accept or assume responsibility   to anyone other than BP for our work, for this   report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
