Chevron takes great pride in our role in an industry   responsible for the greatest advancements in economic   development and human progress in recorded history.
And we take seriously our responsibility to help meet the   needs of people who aspire to a better quality of life.
To ful˙ll this responsibility, we are guided by The Chevron  Way.
Its vision, values and strategies guide us as we   ful˙ll our purpose: enabling human progress by develop-  ing the energy that improves lives and powers the   world forward.
Energy is one of the world™s most complex industries.
Delivering the energy of today in a socially and environ-  mentally responsible way while innovating the energy   solutions of tomorrow requires a network of partners and   relationships built on trust and integrity.
As described by the United Nations Sustainable Develop- ment Goals, the world continues to strive for progress    to bene˙t global societies.
Chevron is contributing to this   progress, working with business, government and nonpro˙t   partners to help address stakeholder needs while creating   value for our stockholders.
Over the past ˙ve years, we™ve invested $167 billion in goods   and services around the world, which has created jobs, built   businesses and strengthened local economies.
In that same   period, we™ve invested more than $1.1 billion globally in social   investment partnerships and programs with a signi˙cant   focus on health, education and economic development.
Across our operations, we support our workforce, our  stakeholders, the communities where we operate and the   environment by doing business the right and responsible   way.
We engage openly and often with stakeholders and   stockholders to understand their perspectives on important   environmental, social and governance issues, some of which   we address in our  2017 Corporate Responsibility Report   Highlights .
This includes the work we™re doing to manage   risk; operate safely and reliably; address climate change;   protect the environment; respect human rights; and   promote diversity and inclusion in our workforce.
Chevron appreciates that climate change is a concern to our  stakeholders, as it is to people who invest in our company.
We™ve published our second report detailing the framework    we use to think about climate change issues.

Among the many duties of the Board   is oversight of Chevron™s policies and practices to ensure   that appropriate risk management systems are employed   throughout the company.
It regularly considers critical    risk topics as part of its deliberative decision-making   process, and annually, as part of Chevron™s Enterprise Risk   Management process, it reviews ˙nancial, operational,   market, political and other risks inherent in our business.
The Board has four standing committees, each composed  solely of independent Directors: Audit, Board Nominating   and Governance, Management Compensation, and Public   Policy.
Each committee ful˙lls important responsibilities to   help Chevron manage risks enterprisewide and compete   more e˝ectively to help build long-term stockholder value.
For example, the Public Policy Committee assists the Board    in ful˙lling its oversight of risks that may arise in connec -tion with the social, political, environmental, human rights   and public policy aspects of Chevron™s business, including   climate change.
The Executive Committee is a committee of corporate oˆcers   chartered by the Board of Directors to carry out policies in  managing the company™s business.

Director nomination process An experienced, talented and diverse board is critical to   Chevron™s success.
In identifying Director nominees, the   Board Nominating and Governance Committee utilizes a   skills and quali˙cations matrix to maintain a balance of   knowledge and experience across key dimensions.
The   committee particularly considers leadership experience;   expertise in science, technology, engineering, research or   academia; extensive knowledge of governmental, regula-  tory, legal or public policy issues; expertise in ˙nance,   ˙nancial disclosure or ˙nancial accounting; experience in   global business or international a˝airs; and environmental    experience.
The committee considers other factors as    appropriate to meet the current needs of the Board and    the company.
The Board seeks to achieve diversity of    age, gender and ethnicity and recognizes the importance    of Board refreshment, as demonstrated by our current   average Board tenure of 4.3 years.
Governance For Chevron, good corporate governance means having   structures and processes in place to ensure that decisions   and actions are in the best interests of our stockholders.
It also means being responsive to our stockholders.
Through   our Investor Relations and Corporate Governance depart -ments, we engage with many of our stockholders to discuss   operational, ˙nancial, governance, executive compensation,  environmental, safety, social and policy issues.
Fostering   long-term relationships and maintaining stockholder trust   and goodwill is a core Chevron objective.
business ethics  Strong ˙nancial results and a solid safety record were    hallmarks of our company performance in 2017.
These suc -cesses were achieved through the demonstration of The   Chevron Way behavior and a commitment to The Chevron   Way valuesŠdiversity and inclusion, high performance,   integrity and trust, partnership, and protecting people and   the environment.
It is on these values that the foundation    of our company is built.
Below are two examples of how    we apply our core values to business decisions and position   ourselves for success.

This means no fatalities or serious injuries and no ˙res,    spills or explosions that can a˝ect people or communities.
To help achieve this objective, in 2017 we developed the    ˙rst signi˙cant update to our OEMS since its deployment    in 2004.  operational excellence management system Through application of our OEMS, we work to understand    and recognize hazards and risks in each area of our   operations, implement appropriate safeguards, and then   assure that the safeguards are in place and functioning.
Our updated OEMS incorporates more than a decade of   learnings and increases our focus on our risk and assurance   programs, all in support of our continued e˝orts to prevent   high-consequence incidents and impacts.
Across our company, we™ve deepened the integration of   risk management through our recently updated Operational   Excellence (OE) Risk Management process.
By applying   this process, our business units consider a broad range of   risks, including safety and health exposures, environmental   issues, facility integrity, security of personnel and assets,   and community and political issues.
This evaluation includes   assessing facility-, activity- and product-related risks across   the life cycle of our business.
Building on the culture established in The Chevron Way,   we have also reemphasized the value of leadership as a   critical success factor in achieving OE results.
Leaders must   cultivate and drive our OE culture through their values,   competencies and behaviors.
They are responsible for   understanding and mitigating risks and maintaining and   assuring safeguards for their business.
At Chevron, we apply and sustain a variety of safeguards  that interrupt a cause-event-consequence sequence, such as   alarms and pressure relief systems.
We have developed   assurance programs to monitor these safeguards through   testing programs, maintenance inspections, operator routine   duty results, and internal and external audits.
These programs   are designed to recognize signs of safeguard weaknesses   and trigger actions to strengthen them.

In the case of an approaching hurricane, our personnel   are safely evacuated and facilities like Jack/St.
Malo   are secured in such a way as to minimize the potential for   damage to the environment and company property.
chevron.com/cr 10Chevron™s emergency management process  addresses the safety of our workforce and the   integrity of our assets.
Regional crisis management   committees (CMCs) composed of cross-functional   experts report to our corporate CMC, and a robust   emergency management community of practice   contributes valuable input and learnings from   around the globe.
Each regional CMC is responsible for having an  emergency management plan in place for all   high-risk scenarios involving Chevron facilities and   operations, including potential natural disasters,   such as hurricanes and earthquakes.
These plans address three areas of preparation:  Ł  Risk assessment and scenario development  Ł  Business continuity, crisis management and  response for all relevant scenarios Ł  Assurance of safeguard e˝ectiveness through   regular exercises and drills Hurricane Harvey   In 2017, our emergency management process    was tested by Hurricane Harvey, the strongest   storm to hit Texas in 57 years.
As the storm   escalated, Chevron promptly activated CMCs to   monitor status of employees and operations and   initiated 25 business continuity plans across the   company.
These well-planned actions enabled   the company to sustain operations and minimize   impacts.
Most important, Chevron experienced    no serious injuries or fatalities among employees.
emergency   preparedness and   response We are focused on providing a safe and healthy work-  place for our employees and contractors.
Our highest    priority is to eliminate fatalities and prevent serious injuries   and illnesses.
personal safety In 2017, we matched the record low for our Days Away    From Work Rate (0.16) and set a new record low for our   Total Recordable Incident Rate (0.13).
Regrettably, we    experienced six fatalities in our Upstream operations.
These tragedies remind us of the inherent risk in our work   and our commitment to never be satis˙ed until everyone    in our workforce goes home safely every day.
Building on our ongoing e˝orts to prevent high-consequence  incidents and impacts, our Upstream segment recently com-   pleted a comprehensive review of critical workforce safety   processes and safeguards.
A series of veri˙cation tools were   deployed to reduce the rate of human error during high-risk   work.
These tools are patterned after the Essential Check-  lists tool used by our Downstream & Chemicals segment.
We continued e˝orts to deploy industry-recognized   Human Performance tools that decrease reliance on human   actions as safeguards and reduce the risk of error.
We   also deployed an instructor training program, which has   been adopted by several business units.
For example, our   Lubricants supply chain organization established learn - ing teams to complete a review step after work has been   completed.
This step enabled the teams to determine which   safeguards worked and which ones needed to be improved,   as well as the modi˙cations that were needed while the   work was being performed.
process safety Since the early 1990s, Chevron has taken a management    system approach to addressing process safety risks.
Through ongoing execution of our Operational Excellence   Management System (OEMS), we have improved our   personal and process safety performance to become an   industry leader in several key areas.
See Page 28 for our    ˙ve-year health and safety performance data.
In our drive to achieve zero serious incidents and fatalities  and attain world-class performance in process safety,    we accomplished two key milestones in 2017.
First, we com-   bined OEMS expectations for process safety, reliability and    integrity into a uni˙ed focus area to help integrate all aspects   of process safety across the life of our assets.
Second, we   created a Complex Process Facilities organization to provide   technical expertise, promote best practices and strengthen   global organizational capability across all such facilities in   both Upstream and Downstream.

continuing the conversation greenhouse gas management We are addressing the GHG emissions in our operations    and integrating GHG emissions management into the    execution of our business activities.
Below is a summary of   recent activities to reduce our emissions.
Methane management Methane from process emissions, vented sources and com - bustion sources (including ˚ares) accounted for 5.5 percent   of Chevron™s total GHG emissions in 2017.
Fugitive sources    of methane comprised 1.6 percent.
** Chevron is a founding partner of The Environmental  Partnership, led by the American Petroleum Institute.
The partnership is an industry initiative with the goal of   accelerating improvements to reduce methane and volatile   organic compound emissions.
The voluntary initiative,   which launched in December 2017, includes more than   25 operators.
It will initially focus on reducing emissions   associated with the removal of liquid buildup in wells;   retro˙tting high-bleed pneumatic controllers with low- or   zero-emitting devices; and implementing the monitoring   and repair of fugitive emissions.
Flaring reduction In 2017, we reduced our enterprisewide ˚are gas volume   rate by 18.7 percent, primarily due to improvements made in   equipment reliability in our Australasia, Nigeria/Mid-Africa   and Southern Africa Strategic business units.
Since 2013, we   have reduced ˚aring by 26.6 percent.
Energy e˘ciency Chevron™s Pipeline & Power organization collaborates with   the company™s Upstream and Downstream businesses to help   lower their energy costs, test new technologies, achieve eˆ-   ciency gains, manage emissions and improve power reliability.
BiofuelsChevron is actively evaluating options for biomass proc -essing as part of our transportation fuels businesses,   particularly in California.
To date, our work, as well as that    of others, to produce second-generation biofuels that are   economical at scale without subsidies has not been success -ful.
This included creating a joint venture with Weyerhaeuser,   then the largest landowner in the United States, to try to   commercialize cellulosic biofuels.

The Environmental Management Expectation of   the updated OEMS Environment Focus Area calls   for our organizations to:  Protect  the environment and community health  using a risk-based approach that addresses   potential acute and cumulative impacts.
Apply environmental design standards and   the mitigation hierarchy to guide selection of    safeguards that:  Ł  Prevent accidental releases  Ł  Reduce air emissions Ł  Conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gases Ł  Manage wastes and wastewater, including those   disposed of at third-party facilities Ł   Conserve and protect water and natural resources* Ł  Retire idle assets and reclaim impacted sites.
Conduct  monitoring, analyze performance, and   identify and address gaps.
*Natural resources include land, water and biodiversity.
environmental   management   expectation Protecting the environment and community health   through responsible design, development, operations and   asset retirement is the central purpose of environmental   management at Chevron.
We assess and manage our    signi˙cant environmental and related community health   risks and address potential acute and cumulative impacts   of our operations through the implementation of our   Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS).
The objectives of the Environment Focus Area of our OEMS   are met, in part, through processes and standards estab-   lished at the corporate and sector levels and are implemented   by regional and local management.
The processes and   standards provide our business with the ˚exibility to focus   on the risks and potential impacts to the environment and   community health most salient to the speci˙c locations   where we operate.
community health Air monitoring is one of the tools used to measure emissions   and help the public better understand local air quality.
Community air monitoring program in California Since 2013, our re˙nery in Richmond, California, has funded    a community air monitoring program.
The program, which    is operated by independent expert Argos Scienti˙c, pro-  vides real-time data 24 hours a day about air quality in the    community.
Data are collected and reported from three    stations along the Richmond Re˙nery™s fence line and    three neighborhood stationsŠNorth Richmond, Atchison   Village and Point Richmond.
Since the launch of the    program, the air monitors have continuously tracked air   quality.
Results show that air quality in Richmond is on par   with other Bay Area communities, including the city of    San Francisco and Marin County.
biodiversity conservation We recognize the importance of biodiversity conservation   and support it through our values, performance, communi - cation and engagement.
Conservation actions in Kazakhstan  To support our integrated FGP/WPMP in Kazakhstan,    vessels will be traveling through the northeastern Caspian   Sea to deliver cargo necessary for completion of the project.
The northeastern Caspian is an area with high biodiversity   value.
We designed and implemented conservation actions   that contribute to the protection of key habitats and species.
For example, the endangered Caspian seal and ˙ve criti-   cally endangered sturgeon species are present in the area.

Recycling industrial-used water in Singapore In 2017, Singapore™s national water agency awarded the   Singapore Re˙ning Company (SRC)*** the inaugural Water   Eˆciency Award in the Re˙ning category for its e˝orts in   water recycling.
The SRC built a recycling plant that further   manages treated wastewater that would otherwise be dis-   charged to the sea.
The plant uses ceramic micro˙ltration   and reverse osmosis, removing suspended solids, oil, grease   and other contaminants from the used water.
Water from   the new plant meets both industrial and potable water   speci˙cations and is recycled back to the re˙nery™s boiler   feed water.
The plant currently meets approximately    20 percent of the SRC™s water demand.
water risk management We have systems, processes and standards to manage this   critical natural resource.
The expectations in our updated   Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS) call for   our organizations to conserve and protect water resources   using a risk-based approach that addresses potential   acute and cumulative impacts across the life of our assets.
Organizations monitor and analyze performance to verify   that the safeguards designed to conserve and protect    water in water-constrained areas are in place.
Our Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment  (ESHIA) process and our Upstream-speci˙c Natural   Resources Environmental Performance Standard (EPS)    are two examples of how the water-related expectations    of our OEMS are executed.
Our Natural Resources EPS    is applied across our onshore Upstream business and capital   projects and calls for a water resources screening assess -ment.
Together with our ESHIA process, these tools help   to identify potentially signi˙cant environmental and social   impacts associated with our water use.
The water resources   screening assessment evaluates and helps us manage the   following risks that may be associated with our water use: Ł   Water availability Ł   Competition for water resources Ł   Impact of water withdrawal on source water quality   or quantity Ł   Sociopolitical risks Ł Regulatory restrictions Where there is potential for signi˙cant impact, a water   resources management plan (WRMP) is developed.
The WRMP helps our operations identify and implement   measures that reduce water withdrawals when possible.
promoting efficient use of water Our operations promote the eˆcient use of water in water-  constrained areas through conservation, reuse and recycling.
Water-sharing agreements in Appalachia Our operations in Appalachia have created partnerships    with select local operators to engage in water-sharing   agreements.
These agreements facilitate reuse of our   produced water** by other operators for their drilling and   hydraulic fracturing activities.
This practice has multifaceted   bene˙ts, including maximizing water recycling to o˝set   freshwater demands and limiting disposal to injection wells.
Since the execution of agreements in March 2017, Chevron  Appalachia has shared approximately 21 million gallons    of water.
water use in   well completions   permian basinchevron.com/cr 17we respect the rights of our community   members, the workers in our supply   chain, our employees and other rights holders   who may be a˝ected by our operations respecting   human rightsintegrity and trust learn morefi fichevron.com/humanrights Guided by The Chevron Way, we conduct our business   in a socially and environmentally responsible manner,  respecting the law and universal human rights to bene˙t    the communities where we work.
Our approach to human    rights is informed by the United Nations Guiding Prin-   ciples on Business and Human Rights.
Below are some of the enterprisewide policies, processes  and procedures that embed our Human Rights Policy in    the way we operate.
labor relations policy  Chevron™s enterprisewide labor relations policy is con-   sistent with the International Labour Organization™s core   labor principles concerning freedom of association and   collective bargaining.
If Chevron employees choose union   representation, a Works Council or labor organization    representation, Chevron™s policy is to attempt to establish    a positive, cooperative business relationship with the   certi˙ed representative of choice.
We seek to adopt labor   relations strategies that foster cooperation, open com - munication, and both employee and union participation in   meeting the goals of the company.
Our business units are   expected to make labor relations decisions consistent    with The Chevron Way, the business unit™s strategies and   business plans, and local government regulations.
addressing potential community impacts  We recognize that our operations have the potential to   a˝ect the well-being of the communities in which we work.
That is why Chevron™s Operational Excellence Management   System includes an Environmental, Social and Health Impact   Assessment (ESHIA) process, which applies to capital   projects within Chevron™s operational control.
The ESHIA   process provides a systematic and risk-based approach to   identifying, assessing and managing potentially signi˙cant   impacts, including human rightsŒrelated issues.
The assessments consider potential impacts our activities  may have on surrounding communities, natural resources, air   quality, and community health and livelihoods.
They incor-   porate human rights due diligence to help the company con - sider how to safeguard the rights and interests of potentially   a˝ected communities.
Obtaining input from communities   and partners is central to the ESHIA process and occurs   throughout a project™s life cycle.
If further assessment is   needed, Chevron teams can conduct more detailed Human   Rights Impact Assessments.
When potential issues related to resettlement of com -munities or engagement with indigenous peoples are   identi˙ed, Chevron™s  Resettlement Guidance  and Indigenous   Peoples Guidance  provide our business units with a road   map for how to navigate those situations in a manner that   respects potentially a˝ected rights holders.
Our  Grievance   Mechanism Guidance  and existing operational-level griev -ance mechanisms enable our business units to identify and   respond to community concerns that may call for remedy.
chevron.com/cr 18 additional resources chevron.com/hrsupplierletter We expect our suppliers to adhere to the  International Labour Organization™s Declaration   on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
That means we expect our suppliers to have policies   and practices in place that allow their employees   freedom of association and that protect against   forced labor, child labor and workplace discrimi - nation.
We seek to implement this expectation   through a variety of due diligence and performance   management processes that we apply to current   and potential suppliers.
For example, in 2017, we   disquali˙ed two companies competing for a contract   after learning of forced labor in their operations.

chevron .com/cr 20Bringing our products to global markets generates   direct bene˙ts for the communities in which we operate.
Chevron seeks to increase opportunities for these   community members to earn a livelihood through local   workforce development and hiring initiatives as well   as supplier development and contracting programs.
Through our strategic social investments, we also partner   with communities to support fundamental economic   development, education and health programs that contrib-  ute to our mutual success.
building local capacity Chevron™s supply chain and workforce investments are   among our most powerful tools for creating prosperity.
We spent more than $24 billion in total goods and services   in 2017, much of it going to locally owned companies in    the communities where we operate.
With that often comes    a further investment of our time and technical capabil-   ities to help build the capacity of these local businesses,    enabling them to win future work with us and other com-   panies.
Our investments can help these local businesses   grow, creating new jobs and bringing more resources into   the local community.
Other direct investments bene˙ting the communities in  which we work are our workforce development and job   training initiatives.
We strive to hire locally as much as pos -sible, which often means helping develop the skills of the   local labor force.
In 2017, 95 percent of Chevron employees   worked in their home country.

HealthChevron invests in programs aimed at improving health    to unlock potential progress and prosperity in the com - munities where we operate.
We bring together the people,   resources and expertise to deliver meaningful change.
When public health issues put employee productivity and  community well-being at risk, it is a business issue that   demands action.
One way we promote the health of our   workforce is through peer-based education programs.
Peer Health Educators (PHEs) are well-trained, motivated   employees who volunteer time to provide their peers with   health-related education and activities.
PHEs are trained   to address personal health holistically and can engage the   workforce and their communities to increase awareness of   personal health and its impact on safety and productivity.
Education  We believe our support for education helps whole commu -nities prosper and gives everyone partnership in the process.
We bring together the people, resources and expertise to   develop innovative programs that invest in tomorrow™s work-   force by educating students, training teachers, providing   classroom resources and preparing workers to excel in their    jobs through workforce training.
We do this because a trained   workforce is needed to build our business, raise awareness   of opportunities for youth, and give back in communities   where we work.
In 2011, Chevron Australia recognized the need to build its  talent pipeline to help increase Aboriginal employment.
We launched the Education to Employment (E2E) pathway,  working with the Aboriginal community, schools, univer -sities and employment pathway providers to help develop   the skills to commence a rewarding career.
Since its launch,   more than 160 Aboriginal Australians have participated in   the E2E pathway initiative, and Aboriginal employment   with in Chevron Australia has increased from four employees  in 2010 to 63 at year-end 2017. bangladesh  partnership initiative In 2014, Chevron announced a commitment to create  the Bangladesh Partnership Initiative (BPI), a multiyear   program to support economic development for com - munities in the Greater Sylhet region.

2 Chevron reports petroleum spills to land and water to conform to  the 2015 IPIECA Reporting Guidance.
Spills to land and water   that are greater than or equal to one barrel are included.
Spills to   secondary containment and chemical spills are excluded.
Of the 3.4 thousand barrels of pe troleum spilled to land and water,  1.9 were spilled as a result of events outside Chevron™s operational   control, such as sabotage.
3 The 13 spills of signi˙cance that Chevron experienced in 2017   ranged in size from 0.01 to 1.7 thousand barrels.
Of the 5.3 thousand   barrels spilled in total, 4.8 were spilled to secondary containment.
Corrections were made to the number of spills of signi˙cance  reported for 2015 and 2016.
For purposes of conforming to the 2015 IPIECA Reporting Guidance,  Chevron de˙nes a spill of signi˙cance as a process safety Tier 1   loss-of-primary containment (LOPC) event (as de˙ned by American   National Standards Institute/American Petroleum Institute [ANSI/  API] Recommended Practice [RP] 754) with a consequence of a   release of material greater than the threshold quantities described   in Table 1 of ANSI/API RP 754 in any one-hour period.
Spills to   secondary containment, regardless of actual environmental impact,   are included, as are chemical spills.
Releases to air are excluded.
4 Fresh water withdrawn totals decreased in 2017 (relative to prior   years) in part due to leaks that were repaired and asset divest -ments.
In addition, our operations in the Permian Basin continued   their transition to the use of brackish water in lieu of fresh water for   well completions.
This transition contributed to an enterprisewide   decrease in fresh water withdrawn and an increase in nonfresh   water withdrawn, as drilling activities increased in 2017.
Refer to   Page 17 of this report for additional information.
2016 fresh water withdrawn, fresh water consumed and nonfresh  water withdrawn have been restated to re˚ect additional informa -tion that was received after the 2016 Corporate Responsibility   Report was published.
Produced water is excluded from fresh water withdrawn, fresh   water consumed and nonfresh water withdrawn.
Fresh water withdrawn from the environment is de˙ned per local  legal de˙nitions.
If no local de˙nition exists, fresh water is de˙ned   as water extracted, directly or indirectly, from surface water,   groundwater or rainwater that has a total dissolved solids con-  centration of less than or equal to 2,000 mg/L.
Fresh water   withdrawn does not include e˛uent or recycled/reclaimed water   from municipal or other industrial wastewater treatment systems,   as this water is reported under nonfresh water withdrawn.
Nonfresh water withdrawn could include: seawater; brackish  groundwater or surface water; reclaimed wastewater from another   municipal or industrial facility; desalinated water; or remediated   groundwater used for industrial purposes.
5 Oil concentration is determined by the sampling of e˛uent   streams, using methods required or recommended by regulatory   agencies or authorities, where applicable.
Chevron reports the   total cumulative amount of oil discharged to surface water exclud -ing spills, which are reported separately.
6 The World Resources Institute/World Business Council for   Sustainable Development  Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate  Accounting and Reporting Standard  de˙nes three ﬁscopesﬂ   that Chevron uses to report GHG emissions.
Scope 1 includes   direct emissions from sources within a facility.
Scope 2 includes   indirect emissions from electricity and steam that Chevron imports.
Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions.
Chevron reports   information related to two types of Scope 3 emissions: emissions  associated with electricity and steam that Chevron exports to third   parties and emissions from third-party use of our products.
7 Direct GHG emissions related to  production  of energy in the form   of electricity or steam exported or sold to a third party have   been included in the reported Scope 1 emissions to conform to the   2015 IPIECA Reporting Guidance.
8 2017 direct GHG emissions, on both an equity and operated basis,   decreased primarily due to reductions in ˚aring and asset divest -ments.
Refer to Page 13 of this report for additional information.
Methane emissions decreased in 2017 due to a change in calculation   methodology in our Thailand operations and asset divestments.
Re˙nements were made in the data reporting for 2015 and 2016  equity and operated GHG emissions.
All six Kyoto GHGsŠcarbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous  oxide (N 2O), sulfur hexa˚uoride, per˚uorocarbons and hydro˚uoro -carbonsŠare included in Chevron™s Scope 1 emissions.
CO 2, CH4  and N2O are accounted for in Chevron™s Scope 2 emissions and in   Chevron™s Scope 3 emissions related to the electricity and steam   that Chevron exports to third parties.
The following entities are not currently included in the 2017  Chevron corporate GHG inventory: Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.,   the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a polyethylene pipe plant and a   valve plant in Kazakhstan, and other nonoperated assets in which   Chevron has an equity interest of 16 percent or less.
Emissions from   the Wheatstone asset have been included in the inventory where   Chevron has operational control, as de˙ned by Australia™s  National  Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 .

9 Chevron calculated emissions from third-party use of our products   by multiplying total 2017 Upstream liquids and gas production   by emissions factors from API™s  Compendium of Greenhouse Gas  Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry  (2004, 2009).
10  The 2017 enterprisewide ˚are gas volume rate decreased due to   improvements made in equipment reliability and lower production   in our IndoAsia business unit.
The 2016 average ˚are gas volume rate has been restated to   correct an error.
In 2017, 15 percent of Chevron™s total direct (Scope 1), operated   GHG emissions were from process emissions and vented   sources, as de˙ned by API™s  Compendium of Greenhouse Gas  Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry  (2004, 2009).
11  Total energy consumption and intensity decreased primarily   due to asset divestments and four cogeneration plants that were   not operating in 2017.
The 2016 energy data have been restated to correct an error   and account for additional information that was received after   the publication of the 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report.
Re˙ning energy performance is measured by the Manufacturing  Energy Index (MEI), which is calculated using the Solomon Energy   Intensity Index methodology.
MEI includes operated assets and   nonoperated joint venture re˙neries.
Energy performance for Oronite, Lubricants, Americas Products  and International Products is measured by the Non-Manufacturing   Energy Index, which is the energy required to produce Chevron   products compared to the energy that would have been required to   produce the same products in 1992 (the index™s base year).
chevron.com/cr 29chevron .com/cr 28notes to   pages 24 through   28, continued   12  VOC and NO x emissions increased in 2017 due to the startup of  major capital projects.
SO x emissions decreased due to reductions  in ˚aring and re˙nements made in data collection processes.
Re˙nements were made in the data reporting for 2016 NO x and  VOC emissions.
For compiling and reporting air emissions data, Chevron follows  regulatory de˙nitions of VOC.
SO x emissions include SO 2 and SO 3, reported as SO 2-equivalent.
NO x emissions include NO and NO 2 (reported as NO 2-equivalent) and exclude N 2O.

13  Hazardous waste generated, disposed of and recycled decreased   due to di˝erences in the types of activities conducted by our   operations in 2017.
To conform to the 2015 IPIECA Reporting Guidance, and where  appropriate information and data exist, our hazardous waste   numbers starting in 2015 exclude remediation waste generated,   disposed of and recycled.
Hazardous waste amounts are quanti˙ed using methods required  or recommended by regulatory agencies or authorities, where  applicable.
In other instances, similar methods are used, including   direct measurement onsite or at the point of shipping, engineering   estimates, and process knowledge.
Chevron follows the regulatory   de˙nitions of hazardous waste applicable to the jurisdictions   in which we operate, including  de minimis speci˙cations (below   which hazardous waste quantities do not need to be reported).
14   Data are based on information that was received from the regula -tory agency and recorded internally prior to the publication of   this report.

A member of the Lloyd™s Register Group.
This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Chevron U.S.A. Inc. in  accordance with our contract, but is intended for the readers of this Report.
Terms of Engagement Lloyd™s Register Quality Assurance Inc. (LRQA) was commissioned by   Chevron U.S.A. Inc. on behalf of Chevron Corporation (Chevron) to provide   independent assurance on its processes used in the creation of the   Corporate Responsibility Report (CRR) for calendar year 2017 to a reason - able level using LRQA™s veri˙cation approach.
Our assurance engagement covered Chevron™s operations and activities  worldwide and speci˙cally covered the following requirements: Ł   Reviewing the e˝ectiveness of the processes for reporting health,   environmental and safety (HES) IPIECA performance indicators.
Ł   Con˙rming consistency with the  IPIECA/API/IOGP oil and gas industry  guidance on voluntary sustainability reporting  (2015) industry guidelines.
Our assurance engagement did not include verifying the accuracy of data   and information reported in the CRR.
LRQA™s responsibility is only to Chevron.
LRQA disclaims any liability or  responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote.
Chevron™s    management was responsible for preparing the CRR and for maintaining   e˝ective internal controls over the reporting processes and CRR.
LRQA™s   responsibility was to carry out an assurance engagement on the reporting   processes in accordance with our contract with Chevron.
Ultimately, the    CRR has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of, Chevron.
LRQA™s Opinion Based on LRQA™s approach, we believe that Chevron™s reporting proc-  esses were e˝ective in delivering HES indicators that are useful for   assessing corporate performance and reporting information consistent   with common reporting elements in the  IPIECA/API/IOGP oil and gas   industry guidance on voluntary sustainability reporting  (2015).
The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a reasonable level   of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgment of   the Veri˙er.
LRQA™s Approach LRQA™s assurance engagement was carried out in accordance with our   Veri˙cation procedure; the following tasks were undertaken as part of   the evidence-gathering process for this assurance engagement: Ł   Visiting Chevron Corporation in San Ramon, California, to review   data collection and checking processes.
Reviewing Chevron Upstream    and Midstream and Chevron Downstream & Chemicals to assess    business-unit understanding and implementation of Chevron™s HES    reporting requirements.
Ł   Visiting Deepwater Exploration and Projects in Houston, Texas; Chevron  Pipe Line Company in Houston, Texas; and the Salt Lake Re˙nery in    Utah to assess local understanding and implementation of Chevron™s   HES reporting requirements.
Ł   Interviewing key personnel to identify and gain an understanding of  Chevron™s reporting requirements, including key persons responsible    for drafting the CRR.
