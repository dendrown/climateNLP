MESSAGE OF HIS HOLINESS POPE FRANCIS TO THE EXECUTIVE  CHAIRMAN OF THE ﬁWORLD ECONOMIC FORUMﬂ ON THE    ˙˛†˚˛˙˛˝˙ ˝  ˚—€˚–˙fi …˙fi˛˛ €˚–˙fi˛˙˙€˙˛fi˙ ˛˛ ˝’€ ˙˛’ €˙ €€˛€˚˛“˙˛˝ƒ 3fi˚˛˛˝˙˚ˆˇ˘ ˇ˛ The global scenario continues to be characterised by strong imbalances.
Today, more than 800 million people sufier  from hunger and 11% of the world™s population has no access to clean water, there are poverty and inequality and one  billion people still live without access to electricity where energy resources abound.
These data Œ described in the ˚rst  pages of Eni for 2018 Œ are a serious call to open our eyes to what is happening around us.
We can't neglect the neg -ative social and environmental efiects of the current development model based on unlimited growth in consumption  and on the ﬁculture of wasteﬂ.
We cannot surrender to the idea that this model is immutable and we must start again from amazement to improve the  garden of which we are the guardians.
Whence the drive to seek new ideas and the courage to change, the desire to  heed the profound existential needs of people and the path that in recent years Œ with efiort and daily work, research  and all the technology at our disposal Œ has led Eni to a new business model capable of long-term investment that  goes beyond the pro˚t maximization logic and look at the global value of individuals.
In 2040, the world population will exceed the 9 billion mark and energy demand will continue to grow.
As a company  operating in this industry, we feel a great responsibility towards the people who live in the countries that host us and  towards a world increasingly conditioned by upheavals, starting with climate change.
Within the framework of the Paris Agreement and adopting the language of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  set out in the United Nations 2030 Agenda, Eni recognizes the need to actively intervene in the ˚ght against climate  change through an accurate integrated strategy that is implemented in our path to decarbonization, as detailed in the  dedicated report.
We wish to contribute to the construction of an energy model in which everyone Œ especially in are -as such as Africa, characterised by a strong demographic boom Œ can have access to innovative and clean mixes.
We  want to bring energy where it is needed, distribute it better, ofier opportunities for development, invest in education  and vocational training, health and access to water with dedicated projects and services of social value.
When the challenge is great and urgent, we must act together, seeking common objectives and values.
For this reason,  we believe it is essential and more fruitful to carry out development initiatives increasingly engaging all actors: gov -ernments, society, international bodies and private sector realities, including investment funds.
The partnership we  signed with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for access to clean and safe water by building wells powered  by photovoltaic systems, the partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) signed in 2018 to  pool expertise on energy access and sustainable development in the Countries in which we operate and the patronage  of the United Nations Educational, Scienti˚c and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) at the Musée polyvalent du Cercle  Africain in Pointe-Noire, Congo, all head in this direction.
Another signi˚cant example is the Oil and Gas Climate Initi -ative (OGCI) that we contributed to found: in September 2018, the OGCI set the ˚rst collective target for reducing the  intensity of methane emissions from upstream aggregate Oil & Gas activities.
In these pages we will talk about how we do business: ˚rst of all, this means constantly aiming for operational excel -lence, starting from the safety of all the people who work for us and with us and respect for the rights of everyone; it  means also contributing to local development and aspiring to be a model and reference for our operational practices,  recognising diversity as a source of wealth and opportunity for self-discovery.
In this awareness, in 2018, Eni drew up  the Eni Statement on Respect for Human Rights in line with the 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles for Business  and Human Rights.
Even in the roughest seas one can go on without sinking, one must join forces to act together and in agreement pur -suing the common good and the innate dignity of every human being, letting us be guided by our values: respect for  cultures, generosity, altruism and ownership, that is the sense of belonging and responsibility that must direct every  action, promoting listening, cohesion and inclusion.
These are the values that allow the Company to transform itself  while remaining true to its identity.

This transformation has  been pursued with speed of action by leveraging skills, know-how and technologies and placing the  sustainability of its business model at the heart of the strategy .Eni is engaged in Oil & Gas exploration and production in over 40 Countries.
The strategic objective of  the business is the organic growth of production, leveraging a portfolio of geographically diversi˚ed  assets, synergies between projects and consolidated relations with producer Countries.
As regards  gas, Eni is involved in all stages of the value chain: supply, trade and sale of gas and electricity, gas  infrastructure, and supply and sale of LNG (Lique˚ed Natural Gas).
In addition, Eni produces and sells  fuels and other petroleum products mainly in Italy and chemical products also from renewables.
Eni is  committed to developing the business of energy from renewable sources, as well as to the remediation,  environmental recovery and securing of disused industrial sites.
The new Industrial Plan gives impetus to growth through an integrated business model.
The portfolio of  conventional assets 1, the high percentage of gas reserves and the development of renewable sources  thanks to synergies with Eni™s industrial assets will favour the evolution of the business model towards  a low-carbon scenario, also thanks to technological development and digitalization in support of asset  integrity and operating e˝ciency.
Moreover, in the Gas & Power sector Eni will continue to restructure its procurement portfolio and re -duce logistics costs, also by increasing integration with other businesses including LNG and Trading.
The Plan provides for the continued development of Green projects, including the start-up of the Gela  green re˚nery plant and the expansion of the Venice plant, as well as the commitment to sustainable  mobility through the increased supply of alternative fuels and the growth of enjoy 2.
Circular economy  initiatives for waste transformation will also be developed; through these, Eni aims to reduce green -house gas emissions in production processes by increasing energy e˝ciency.

THE PROFOUND  TRANSFORMATION  OF THE COMPANY'S  BUSINESS STARTED   MORE FINANCIALLY  SUSTAINABLE AND  RESILIENT TO THE  SCENARIO VOLATILITY  THAN EVER BEFORE 6’ ’˙˛⁄˙ˆ Eni is a company that operates on a global scale and in an industry critical for the achievement of the  sustainable development goals set by the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations.
Therefore, it is called  upon to address the current macro trends and to participate in the global challenges that the world will  face in the coming years.
Today, world population has exceeded the 7.5 billion mark and 83% of it lives  in less developed areas, which are often rich in resources.
According to UN forecasts,  by 2040 world  population will exceed 9 billion people .
Therefore, in the New Policies Scenario (NPS) of the Interna -tional Energy Agency (IEA) 3, global energy demand is expected to grow by 27% by 2040 compared to  2017 levels , driven mainly by non-OECD Countries (+45%).
At the same time,  it is necessary to combat climate change, limiting emissions of climate-changing  gases into the atmosphere and contributing to the gradual decarbonization  of the energy system  through an energy transition.
According to the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), based on  the baseline assumption of achieving the Paris target 4, emissions should be reduced by 46% in 2040  compared to 2017 5.ENI™S MAIN CHALLENGE  IS ENSURING ACCESS  TO ENERGY RESOURCES  FOR ALL EFFICIENTLY  AND SUSTAINABLY WHILE  COMBATING CLIMATE  CHANGECO2 emissions (Gton) 2000 2017 2025 2030 2035 2040 Current Policies Scenario  (CPS) Sustainable Development Scenario  (SDS)New Policies Scenario  (NPS) 0.012.5 25.0 37.5 50.0 Source: IEA (2018) World Energy Outlook.

3) New Policies Scenario (IEA - WEO 2018).
For more details on this and the other two IEA scenarios mentioned below, see: https://www.iea.org/weo2018/scenarios/.
4) The objective is to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2 degrees with respect to pre-industrial levels.
5) According to the other two IEA scenarios, the already mentioned NPS and the CPS (Current Policies Scenario), emissions by 2040 will increase by 10% and 30% respectively.
PRIMARY ENERGY DEMAND   CO EMISSIONS   ACCORDING TO THE  SDS SCENARIO OF IEA 9 BILLION+27%46%7˛˙ˆˆ Eni™s business model is focused on creating value for its stakeholders and shareholders.
Eni recognizes  that the main challenge in the energy sector is providing e˝cient and sustainable access of local commu -nities to energy resources, while combating climate change.
This challenge may trigger new paradigms of  development afiecting patterns of consumption and supply, as well as on industrial processes.
In this framework, Eni has adopted a systemic approach to pursue e˝ciency, resilience and growth,  which organically integrates sustainability to make it business, incorporates emerging trends of decar -bonisation and inclusive development including them in its industrial plan and in the operating model.
Eni, therefore, adopts a business model, fuelled by the application of own innovative technologies and the  digitalization process, leveraging on the following levers:  1 operational excellence, 2 carbon neutrality in  the long term, 3 promotion of local development.
E˝ciency and integration are the strategic drivers leading Eni™s business towards  operational excellence .This allows the achievement of low cash neutrality, a low time-to-market and a high value resource portfolio,  resilient also in low carbon scenario.
The excellence of the operating model is also characterized by a steady  commitment to minimize risks and create opportunities all along the value chain through the valorization of  human resources, the safeguard of health and safety, the environmental protection, respect and promotion of  Human Rights and focus on transparency and anti-corruption.
Secondly, Eni™s business model envisages a path to decarbonisation with the ambition to lead the Company to  become  carbon neutral  in the long term, aiming at maximize e˝ciency and reduce direct emissions through  the compensation of residual emissions, promoting an energy mix with a low carbon impact.
In the long term, Eni supports a change of energy paradigm and a conversion of the current consumption pat -tern towards a more sustainable and rational one, leveraging on the principles of circular economy, pursuing a  path to conversion by exploiting the group™s expertise and positioning in the downstream business.
Promotion of local development  in Eni™s Countries of activities is the third lever of the business model.
First of all, we supply our gas production to the local market, expanding access to electricity and by promoting  a large portfolio of initiatives addressed to local communities: from local economies diversi˚cation, to projects  for health, education, access to water and hygiene.
This ﬁDual Flagﬂ approach leverages on the collaboration with institutions, cooperation agencies and local stake -holders in order to identify actions to satisfy the needs of communities in accordance with the national devel -opment plans and the 2030 UN Agenda.
Eni is also committed to create job opportunities and transfer its know-how and expertise to the local partners.
fi˚˛˝˙ˆ˚ 8˙˛˝’  Travelling through time, from its beginnings to the present day, Eni has changed tremendously.
Meet -ings, decisions, signatures, and every step taken have changed the course of events, in the Company,  in Italy and in the world.
These stages have been marked by the ability to innovate over the years, al -ways paying special attention to people and local communities, and to the continuous search for solu -tions to design a future in which everyone can access energy resources in an e˝cient and sustainable  manner.
From 2014 Eni has been profoundly renewed thanks to its people and a new integrated  business model that leverages new business opportunities to create shared value in the long term.
Below are some of the milestones of Eni™s sustainability journey.

Eni™s governance structure re -fiects the Company™s desire to integrate sustainability into its business model .
The Board of Directors (BoD) plays a central role in de˚ning, based on the proposal of the Chief Execu -tive O˝cer (CEO), sustainability policies and strategies, in identifying annual, four-year and long-term  objectives shared by functions and subsidiaries and in verifying the related results, which are also  presented to the Shareholders™ Meeting, with this document and the Consolidated Disclosure of Non-Fi -nancial Information 7.
In carrying out its tasks in the ˚eld of sustainability, the Board of Directors is supported, as from 2014,  by the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee, with proactive and advisory functions on scenarios  and sustainability .
The Committee is an important forum for monitoring sustainability issues integrated  into the Company™s business model, such as climate change and Human Rights 8.
Eni™s BoD has also  ap-pointed an Advisory Board  to analyse, among other things, issues related to the decarbonization process  on behalf of the Board and the CEO.
In addition, the CEO™s  Variable Incentive Plan  for 2018 and 2019  includes environmental and human capital sustainability objectives.
These objectives are also set out for  executives with strategic responsibilities and supported by other sustainability objectives (for example,  relating to Human Rights, local interventions, SDGs and Public-Private Partnerships) in line with the spe -ci˚c responsibilities of the role held and with the provisions of the Company™s Strategic Plan.

To ensure that its initiatives and conduct are implemented in such a way as to respect and consider the  perspective of all the categories of stakeholders concerned,  Eni has made sustainability an integral part  of its business model .
To this end,  Eni has set up, under the direct supervision of the Chief Services  & Stakeholder Relations O˛cer, a cross-cutting sustainability structure "Responsible and Sustaina -ble Enterprise (IMPRESSO)" , which oversees the de˚nition of sustainability policies, methodologies and  tools, promoting ever greater integration with operational processes.
IMPRESSO coordinates and super -vises all sustainability-related activities, from monitoring the evolution of the external context to the set -ting of sustainability objectives for the Strategic Plan and the development of initiatives in the Countries  in which Eni operates and makes use, at local o˝ces, of liaisons to de˚ne development plans for the local  community.
This organization provides tangible and proactive support to the Managing Directors for the  implementation of sustainability initiatives with which Eni contributes to value creation for all categories  of stakeholders and to the socio-economic growth of the Countries in which it operates.
CHIEF SERVICES & STAKEHOLDER RELATIONS OFFICER CROSS-CUTTING SUPPORT FUNCTION  TO ALL THE BUSINESS LINES IMPRESSO STRUCTURE RESPONSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENTERPRISE LOCAL LEVEL MANAGING DIRECTOR + SUSTAINABILITY LIAISON PRESIDENT PIETRO GUINDANI   INDIPENDENT DIRECTOR,  PRESIDENT OF THE  SUSTAINABILITY AND  SCENARIOS COMMITTEE ˛˝˙€˙˝€˛˝’ fi Interview with the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee President.
In 2018, the Committee met 12 times and the meetings had an attendance rate of 96%.
At its meetings, the Committee discussed the following issues: scenarios, climate, environment and  technologies, social issues, including Human Rights and non-financial reporting.
President Guindani, what are the reasons that led to the establishment of the Sustainability and  Scenarios Committee chaired by you and what are the main issues of discussion?
The Board of Directors, with marked foresight, has set up an internal Committee dedicated to the themes  of "Scenarios and Sustainability".
This choice implies a fundamental programmatic meaning that the evo -lution of the long-term scenarios of the energy sector are intrinsically linked to the sustainability of the  scenarios themselves, in a relationship of mutual dependence between human development, environ -mental dynamics, evolution of production technologies, distribution and energy consumption and indus -try perspectives.
At the same time, this choice of governance signifies the awareness that Eni's business  model will also evolve according to the energy transition scenarios that will occur.
This approach is, in  the opinion of the Board of Directors, the most appropriate for preserving the value of the Company and  for seizing development potential that can create additional value for all stakeholders in the proactive,  rather than reactive management of the portfolio of strategic initiatives.
The balance between the deep -ening of long-term evolutionary scenarios and the timely review of developments actually observed in  the relevant markets and in the evolution of technologies, has led the Committee to examine a broad, but  intrinsically organic, number of main issues such as energy and sustainability scenarios, environmental  and climate evolution, decarbonization strategies, the evolution of research and development of innova -tive technologies in the energy field, both in terms of energy sources and demand, segmented by end  markets, the management of relations with stakeholders in the areas where Eni operates and a series of  relevant collateral issues.
The advisory function of the Committee was therefore substantiated by an ac -tion aimed at promoting, towards the Board of Directors, issues that are crucial for long-term development  and for Eni's positioning on issues of general importance for the economy and society.
˛˝˙€˙‹ 12˛˝˙⁄€˙“˙˛˝ Eni has developed and adopted an  Integrated Risk Management Model 9 to ensure that management  takes risk-informed decisions, with full consideration of  actual and potential future risks, including  medium and long-term ones, as part of an organic and comprehensive vision .
The integrated risk management model: „ attributes the  Board of Directors with a central role in defining the nature and level of risk com -patible with the strategic targets  including in the valuation process all those risks which could be  consistent for the sustainability of the business in the medium/long-term; „ provides for a  quarterly analysis of the Company™s risk profile  through periodic risk assessment &  treatment and monitoring cycles, the results of which are presented to the Board of Directors and the  Board of Statutory Auditors on a quarterly basis; „ is based on  impact assessments  that consider potential impacts, both quantitative (economic, finan -cial or operational) and qualitative (such as environment, health and safety, social, reputation).
Two assessment cycles were carried out in 2018: the Annual Risk Pro˚le Assessment in the ˚rst half  of the year, which involved 80 subsidiaries in 27 Countries, and the Interim Top Risk Assessment in  the second half of the year, which involved updating assessments and treatment actions for Eni™s top  risks and the main risks at business level.
In addition, three monitoring cycles were carried out on the  top risks.
The  portfolio of Eni™s top risks  consists of  18 risks  classi˚ed into external, strategic and operational  risks.
The following table shows the main risks with ESG (environment, social, governance) efiects  whose main mitigation actions 10 can be analysed in greater detail in Eni for.

The availability and development of cutting-edge technological ex -pertise at the service of innovation and sustainability and the continuous commitment expanding the  areas of application of the energy solutions identi˚ed are the common denominator of the activities.
Research projects cover every aspect of the production chain, with the aim of reducing risks and in -creasing e˝ciency, consolidating technological leadership and generally achieving greater quality,  e˝ciency and sustainability in products, plants and processes.
R&D becomes, therefore, the driver to  create value, with the aim of minimizing the time to market needed for research to result in the devel -opment of technologies and their implementation on an industrial scale.
The R&D objectives are set out in the following strategic guidelines: „ develop key technologies for  asset development , ensuring the highest level of e˝ciency, safety and  minimum environmental impact, reducing CAPEX, OPEX and time to market activities; „ reduce, capture, transform or store CO 2, promote natural gas  by integrating it with renewable energy  and developing innovative energy technologies; „ reduce the use of raw materials, including through recycling , transforming waste into products with  value added, with a view to development based on the principles of the circular economy.
˝‘’˙˛˙€ ˝˙˛‹‹ Eni measures the value generated by applying innovative technologies developed both in-house and  with third parties.
In 2018, the estimated tangible value generated, i.e.
the economic bene˚ts associ -ated with the application of innovative product/process technologies, was •921 million, slightly higher  than in 2017, mainly due to the contribution of proprietary software and technologies.
Moreover, to  enhance internal skills, Eni is committed to spreading technical knowledge across all the functions  and also through the Knowledge Management System (#KMS), focusing on two aspects: the quality of  shared content and the integration of business lines on technical problem-solving issues.

In order for the transformation to be carried out organically, a  structured  change management  process is necessary to renew the Company culture and change the  traditional approach to work, identifying more ˛exible and agile paths and adequate tools to involve  people rationally and emotionally.
Digital transformation is an opportunity for everyone: it allows us to  operate with greater safety (see p. 31), provides new ways of working, enhances knowledge, makes us  faster, more e˝cient, more ˛exible, and more sustainable towards the environment and stakeholders  and more competitive within the reference market.
˙€fi˚“—˝ In January 2018, at the Green Data Center in Ferrera Erbognone, Eni  launched the new mainframe called HPC4, quadrupling the power  of the entire infrastructure and making it the most powerful in the  world at an industrial level.
PROJECT GOALS:  accelerate the time-to-market of Eni™s projects  and optimize ˚eld management strategies for all production assets.
RESULTS:  Thanks to HPC4 (which has a computing power of 18.6  PetaFLOPS), in May 2018, Eni set a record in the numerical model -ling of Oil & Gas ˚elds: in just 15 hours the mainframe performed  100,000 simulations of high-resolution ˚eld models, taking into  account geological uncertainties.
To perceive the amount of computing capacity achieved by Eni, suf -˚ce it to think that HPC3* and HPC4 together reach a peak of 22.4  quintillion operations per second.
Thanks to these technological ca -pabilities, Eni can tap the potential of big data acquired through its  operational activities.

In the  short term  Eni™s strategy is  based on the followings levers: …˙˛˛˙ˆ Eni added to its traditional business the green fuel production  through the conversion of the Venice and Gela traditional re˚neries  into biore˚neries thanks to Eco˚ning Œ a proprietary technology  Œ which enables the production of green diesel by using difierent  typologies of biological origin raw materials (virgin vegetable oils,  waste oils and oils coming from processes that treat other biological  origin material, also including waste, animal fats and by-products  from the food industry).
Focus on the sustainability of biomass used is a priority and Eni,  beyond the de˚nition of a speci˚c policy, is carrying out initiatives  related to ˚rst generation feedstock substitution.
MORE DETAILS ON THE ANNEX    ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND DIRECT GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTION OF OPERATED ACTIVITIESThe objective for 2025 is to reduce upstream emission intensity by 43% compared to 2014.
This objective will contribute to the target of improving the operating efficiency index by 2% a year by 2021 compared to 2014 and it will be pursued by all Eni business units.LOW CARBON AND RESILIENT OIL & GAS PORTFOLIOEni™s hydrocarbon portfolio has a high incidence of natural gas (>50%), a bridge to a low-emission future.
The main upstream projects being executed have a mean portfolio break-even point at a Brent price of $25 per barrel and are therefore resilient in low carbon scenarios.DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLES AND GREEN BUSINESS WITH A CIRCULAR APPROACHThe promotion of renewables aims at reaching an installed electricity generation capacity equal to more than 1.6 GW by 2022.

More levers of Eni™s decarbonization strategies are the growth of low carbon sources (with an increase of  biofuel in the portfolio and the ambition of achieving a gas share of 60% in the hydrocarbons production),  an increase of the zero emissions sources (such as solar photovoltaic, wind and hybrid systems with the  ambition of achieving an installed capacity of 10GW by 2030 from renewable sources) and a circular ap -proach which maximizes waste used as feedstock and that transforms and extends assets useful life.
The decarbonization path aims to make the Company carbon neutral in  the long term , developing an inte -grated energy transition plan, from both the e˝ciency maximization and the direct emission reduction,  promoting an energy mix with a low carbon impact, developing  circular economy and o˝set initiatives  through forestry projects development.
Finally, a key role will be played by new technologies use for the  capture and use of CO 2 emitted.
Overall spending in the four-year period 2019-22 for decarbonization, the circular economy and renewa -bles is approximately •3.6 billion (it includes •0.5 billion for scienti˚c and technological research activities  designed to support these issues).
In particular, these dedicated investments share is equal to the 9% of  the total investments envisaged for the coming 4 years.
˚€˙ˆ˝€€˚–˙fi˝ˆ Within its decarbonization strategy, Eni plans to ofiset part of its  emissions using carbon credits generated by projects aiming to  conserve, restore and manage forests.
These projects aim to reduce  deforestation and forest degradation and preserve the biodiversity,  ensuring also economic and social co-bene˚ts for local communities.
In particular, these projects intend to enable economic diversi˚cation  activities, with the creation of new employment, easing local devel -opment, consistently with the National Development Plans and the  Agenda 2030.
Rational use of forest resources allows also to promote  more sustainable domestic behavior through clean cooking.

It is pre -cisely for this reason that, in the days of a shrinking Oil & Gas market, when all operators needed  to recover e˝ciency also by cutting stafi (resulting between 2014 and 2016 in a reduction of about  400,000 people in the Oil & Gas sector 13), Eni is pursuing a difierent path with strategies that focus on  its people, so as to maintain and develop their technical skills.
Thanks to this approach, in the period 2014-2016, despite a highly volatile market scenario, Eni reor -ganised itself with a simpler, more integrated and compact structure and implemented an e˝ciency  policy centred also on the conversion of important industrial plants in Italy without any reduction in  personnel (over 1,000 people trained for new activities).
In that same period, another historical success was achieved: the  discovery of Zohr , the largest gas  ˙ WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO ENI?
Eni™s business model is based on skills, an asset that is built up over time and with dedication and which  increases its value in the long term.

26˛fi’†’’€ Eni considers plurality a resource, a source of enrichment and a heritage that makes the Company stronger  and better able to face complex global challenges.
The  values of diversity and plurality  are also conveyed  and consolidated through a performance system that involves Eni™s entire management and all of its peo -ple with management objectives linked to the diversity.
Alliances with the Countries in which Eni operates  has always been a hallmark of its international presence.
The aim is to create value through the transfer  of knowledge, while respecting local cultures.
Con˚rming this,  in the upstream sector, the percentage of  local employees out of the total workforce increased signi˚cantly in Countries with a historical presence  (such as Nigeria, Congo, Egypt, Libya and Kazakhstan),  reaching 87%, compared to Countries that have  recently joined the Group  (such as Mexico, Ghana and Myanmar), where the process of transferring know- how is still in progress.
In addition,  in all the Countries in which Eni operates, it ensures minimum levels of  remuneration for local sta˝ that are signi˚cantly higher than market levels .Eni promotes projects with local universities to support the inclusion and development of profession -als in the energy sector in the Countries in which it operates, such as the HUMAN CAPITAL PROJECT 15 - Kazakhstan Deployment promoted by the World Economic Forum.
Moreover, with reference to the  promotion of gender equality , Eni™s approach to fostering greater rep -resentation of women at all levels is focused on three main drivers: „ objectives for  improvement in selection processes, internal development  and participation in train -ing/engagement initiatives involving all managers;  „ initiatives aimed at  encouraging the entry of women into technical career paths  (such as Think  About Tomorrow Œ Percorsi per Giovani Donne, Inspiring Girls and Elis Œ Sistema Scuola Impresa 16) and events aimed at middle, high school students and at universities, also with the involvement of  women role models from the company; „ corporate welfare tools  to promote the work-life balance of people with family responsibilities.

Eni is also a member of national and international associations and participates in initiatives  and benchmarks aimed at sharing best practices, identifying common actions in the ˚eld of gender  equity and enhancing women™s leadership.
In particular, Eni has joined and signed: „ Manifesto for Female Employment 17;„ Europe-wide call for action for inclusion and diversity: pledge "Inclusion and Diversity", promoted  through the campaign #EmbraceDifference 18.The diversity of Eni™s people in terms of age is another factor of plurality .
To enhance the knowledge  of senior employees, initiatives have been implemented in recent years to encourage intergenerational  exchange, such as the Mentoring project, in which experienced managers support the professional  path of younger resources, and the Eni Faculty, with 550 active trainers to enhance the internal capital  of knowledge and develop the ability to pass it on.
‹˙’ Eni invests in  improving people™s wellbeing in order to promote engagement, the bond with the  Company and the creation of a climate oriented towards collaboration .
Welfare programs are also  fundamental tools for pursuing diversity objectives, with particular reference to people with family  responsibilities.
The initiatives illustrated below refer to the main areas of intervention.
In particular, in  2018 Eni focused on strengthening  smart working  and initiatives to support emerging needs, such as  the  care of elderly family members and dependent family members .17) Policy document signed between the companies associated with Valore D and the Italian Presidency of the Council of Ministers.

FOR THE EMPLOYEES'  ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 29—˙˚—’˙ Eni believes that health protection is essential and it  promotes the physical, psychological and social  well-being of Eni™s people, their families and the communities of the Countries in which it operates .
The extreme variability of the business contexts in which Eni operates, from a geographical, climatic,  epidemiological, social, political and regulatory point of view, requires the constant updating of the  health risk matrices and makes it particularly challenging to ensure health at every stage of the busi -ness cycle.
To rise to this challenge, Eni has developed a speci˚c operational platform that ensures  access to services, covering occupational health, industrial hygiene, traveller health, healthcare and  medical emergency, as well as the health promotion initiatives for its people and local communities.
In this context, Eni pursues the following objectives: „ promote and maintain the health and well-being of Eni people by ensuring adequate  disease prevention ; „ ensure adequate  risk management in the workplace  and the development of health monitor -ing programs; „ identify, develop and  implement sustainable programs that ensure a positive impact on the health  of  the populations of host Countries; „ ensure the application of the  principles of occupational medicine , access to primary care and services  for medical emergencies in every operating context.

30In 2018, the main interventions concerned the consolidation of injury rates, the consolidation of the  safety culture, the focus on asset integrity, process safety and emergency management activities.
˛€˝˙˛˝˙€ The total recordable injuries rate (TRIR) increased by 6% compared to 2017.
The worsening was de -termined by the employees™ index (due to an increase in accidents), while the contractors™ index re -mained stable.
In 2018, there were four fatal accidents involving contractors (1 in Nigeria as a result  of crushing by a maneuvering vehicle, 1 in Algeria as a result of burns, 2 in Egypt for falls from height)  and two serious accidents (in Alaska, a contractor who sufiered severe trauma to his right leg and in  Egypt, a contractor who fell from height).
The identi˚cation and analysis of the causes of the accidents in 2018 made it possible to identify the  following actions aimed at preventing the repetition of such events: „ consolidating the  leadership and commitment of management , both of Eni and of contractors, in or -der to spread the safety culture; „ strengthening  the Works Management and operational management  in the field (through the control  of contractors, checks on work permits, use of electronic work permits - E-WP); „ focusing on activities related to the  management of contractors  both in the qualification phase (re -defining the minimum HSE requirements for each type of service) and in the management of the con -tractual relationship (through Kick off Meetings and periodic audits to verify compliance with contrac -tual requirements); „ providing  specific training  for operating personnel, in particular to supervise contractors; „ verifying the correct  implementation of HSE operating procedures , standards and best practices and  the implementation of lessons learned resulting from accidents to have occurred in other realities with  a view to continuous improvement.
In the light of this, Eni has also continued its commitment to the consolidation of the Severity Incident  Rate (SIR), an internal index that takes into account the level of severity of incidents, and the Safety  Culture Programme (SCP), an indicator of preventive safety management.
In particular, the SIR is used  in the short-term incentive plan of the CEO and senior managers with strategic responsibilities to focus  Eni™s commitment on reducing the most serious accidents.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO ENI?
Eni considers the safety of people an essential part of its operations, a fundamental value to be shared between  employees, contractors and local communities.
For this purpose, Eni takes all the necessary steps to eliminate  the occurrence of accidents, including: risk assessment and management organizational models, training plans,  skills development and promotion of a safety culture.

FOR MORE DETAILS ON CIRCULAR     MORE DETAILS ON ENI.COM AND ON THE  SYNDIAL WEBSITE 35˝˙€ Eni uses water mainly for cooling and steam production.
In 2018,  92% of water withdrawals were from  the sea , 7% from freshwater and the remaining 1% from brackish water.
Water withdrawals are mainly  used in chemical processes, which account for 54% of the total.
In line with the trend recorded in recent years, in 2018 Eni also reduced its total freshwater withdrawals  by 2% compared to 2017.
This result was made possible by new steam generators installed in the Porto  Marghera petrochemical plant, which made it possible to reduce the amount of freshwater used in the  cooling cycles.
As a complement to interventions on the plants, Eni has reached a percentage of reuse  of freshwater equal to 87% and, through the four-year strategic plan, it intends to increase the ground -water treated and reused for civil or industrial purposes and, likewise, to launch initiatives for the use of  low-quality water to replace freshwater.
‹˝€˙ Eni pursues the efficient management of water, especially in water stressed areas and performs an  an-nual mapping and monitoring of water risks  and drought scenarios to define long-term actions, also to  prevent and mitigate the effects of climate change.
Only a small proportion of Eni™s total water withdraw -als come from freshwater sources (less than 7%) and, of these, less than a third in water stressed areas.
Only 16% of these withdrawals refer to the upstream sector, while the remaining proportion is attributable  to the Chemicals and downstream sectors.
In addition, the actual value of withdrawals in water stressed  areas is less than 2% as some sites, following in-depth analyses on site, were not at risk.

In Italy, Eni is committed to increasing, over the period of the four-year plan, the amount of  polluted groundwater treated and reused for civil or industrial purposes, to launching initiatives and  assessments for the use of poor quality water (waste water or water from polluted groundwater, as  well as rainwater and desalinated sea water), replacing fresh water, and reducing the water intensity  of production.
Considering the potential risks of possible water crises, as noted by the annual survey  conducted by the World Economic Forum and the growing demand for information by stakeholders, for  the ˚rst time, in 2018, a public response was provided to the CDP water to increase transparency on  these issues.
˛†‹ˆ CONTEXT AND PROJECT GOALS The Eni multi-company site in Brindisi, where an EniPower thermo -electric power plant, a Versalis petrochemical plant and a Syndial  remediation plant are located, lies in a water stressed area.
During  2018, a project was implemented at this site to reduce both seawa -ter and freshwater withdrawals.
RESULTS  At the EniPower site, through the project, which received approval by  the Italian Ministry of the Environment, a new plant has been built.
It has been in operation since September 2018 and replaces both  the old thermal desalination system supplied with seawater and the  existing demineralisation modules* that used freshwater from wells  and the Cillarese basin.
Thanks to the project, freshwater consump -tion can be reduced by 52%, equal to about 990,000 m 3/year, i.e.,  about 13% of the water consumption of a city the size of Brindisi.
The demineralised water produced is used both for thermoelectric  production and in the production processes of the co-located com -panies.
The plant continues to use seawater as the main raw materi -al but, while ensuring the same production, it makes it possible to re -duce both withdrawals by about 6 million m 3 a year and the amount  of chemicals needed for conditioning seawater.
NEXT STEPS A further improvement provides that, as an alternative discharging  into the sea, part of the water treated by Syndial™s TAF** plant can be  sent to the new plant and reused in the production processes of the  companies co-located at the petrochemical site.
In particular, it is  estimated that from the second half of 2019 about 125 m 3/h of water  will be used from the TAF plant.

In 2018, the number of barrels spilled in operational oil spills has decreased by 20% compared with 2017.
The year 2018 saw a reduction in the number of incidents by sabotage, while the volume spilled increased  by 14% especially due to sabotage activities in the upstream sector in Nigeria and Egypt.
In terms of pre -paredness and response, in Italy Eni completed the risk analysis of the areas crossed by pipelines, iden -tifying the most sensitive points at which to set up potential containment actions in advance.

In this re -gard, in 2018, Eni completed the installation of the e-vpms® (Eni  Vibroacustic Pipeline Monitoring System - proprietary patent)  and SSPS (Safety Security Pipeline System) tools on pipelines  in Italy and on part of those in Nigeria; „ the development of solutions to prevent sabotages.
In particu -lar, in 2019, two pilot pipelines will be equipped with an upgrade  of the e-vpms® system, called TPI (Third Party Intrusion), to  detect activities close to of the pipeline (such as excavations  and transiting vehicles) and allow, therefore, the intervention  before the sabotage is completed.
If successful, this system  will then be extended to pipelines for finished products in other  Countries, including Italy.
PERFORMANCEﬂ 38 Eni operates in multiple environmental contexts worldwide, characterized by diverse ecological sensi -tivity and different regulatory systems.
Management of BES (Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services)  issues  is a key component of the integrated Health, Safety and Environmental management system  as well as of  operating practices .
Eni ensures that the interrelations between environmental aspects  like ecosystem services, climate change, water resource management and social issues, such as the  sustainable development of local communities, are identified and managed correctly, as set out in the  BES Policy.
Also through collaboration with international scientific partners, Eni assesses the risks  linked both to the complexity of each project and to the value of the natural environment and local so -cial context.
By applying the Mitigation Hierarchy 22, priority is given to preventive mitigation measures,  monitoring their effectiveness and adapting its management approach based on the results observed.
“ Œ’ CONTEXT In the RSF-5 onshore Block, in central Myanmar, 3D seismic acquisi -tion activities carried out during the exploration of the ˚eld covered  an area of 520 km 2, characterized by the presence of sensitive areas  equal to 1/3 of the entire seismic layout.
A pool of international and  local biologists conducted a biodiversity survey to verify the condi -tion of the sensitive areas where vulnerable and endangered species  were found according to the IUCN Red List** classi˚cation and other  sensitive species of local ˛ora and fauna.
In addition, Eni conducted  interviews in 8 villages to map the use that local communities make  of natural resources and the value they attach to the environment for  religious, archaeological and cultural reasons.
PROJECT Eni rigorously implemented the Mitigation Hierarchy during seismic  operations, applying various measures to avoid and/or minimize pos -sible impacts, including, for example:  „ exclusion of sensitive areas from the seismic layout due to their  biodiversity value or possible related social sensitivities; „ presence of a local biologist for the daily assessment of environmen -tal and social critical factors in the design of the seismic layout; „ implementation of an action plan to manage the area in a manner  respectful of traditions and periodically inform communities about  seismic activities, compensating for any damage with a reliable,  transparent and fair mechanism; „ seismic activities were conducted using 80% of existing improved  roads, minimizing potential indirect impacts.
RESULTS The application of the preventive steps of the Mitigation Hierarchy al -lowed the seismic survey activities to have no direct negative efiects  on the surrounding biodiversity and ecosystem services.
It also enabled building consensus and trust with local communities,  NGOs and local authorities.

FOR MORE DETAILS ON THE BES  POLICY AND MANAGEMENT,  WITH APPLICATION EXAMPLES,  SEE ENI.COM 3923) The salient issues identify the main issues identi˚ed at Eni with regard to Human Rights.
In 2018, Eni published the " Eni Statement on Respect for Human Rights " approved by the Board of Di -rectors to illustrate its approach to the issue, the standards adopted and the commitments to meet its  internationally recognized responsibilities.
The document, addressed to Eni™s stakeholders, including  employees, business partners and local communities, identi˚es  salient Human Rights issues 23 taking  into account the Company™s operating environment and outlines current standards and processes.
This Statement, shared with authoritative third-party organizations, was created by the inter-functional  working group on ﬁHuman Rights and Business,ﬂ which was set up in 2017 following an event chaired  by the CEO addressed to the members of the BoD, Board of Statutory Auditors and Management on the  issue of Business and Human Rights.
The document testi˚es to Eni™s commitment to the "Guiding Prin -ciples on Business and Human Rights" approved by the United Nations in 2011.
ˆ WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO ENI?
Eni™s approach to Human Rights is based on the dignity of every human being and the responsibility of companies to  contribute to the well-being of local communities.
The continued commitment to guaranteeing respect for Human Rights  is based on a due diligence process to ensure compliance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  by providing access to remedial measures in the event of impacts resulting from the activities of its subsidiaries.

In 2018, the process of  integrating Human Rights into all dimensions of Eni™s operations  continued.
To this end, it was fundametal the support of the  Inter-functional Working Group on Human Rights and  Business , which, between 2017 and 2018, made it possible to identify the main areas for improvement  and chart out a multi-year plan.
This plan was broken down into  management objectives  linked to Human  Rights performance and that fall within the MBOs of 50% of the managers directely reporting to the CEO,  such as, for example, the Chief Upstream O˝cer and the Chief Exploration O˝cer, as well as the Chief Ser -vices & Stakeholder Relations O˝cer whom the procurement and security processes depend on.
Respect  for Human Rights is integrated at various levels in Company processes and the risk of possible abuses is  monitored with speci˚c instruments, such as  the Integrated Risk Management (IRM) 24 model.

A training course on Human Rights in the supply  chain has also been developed and will be delivered in 2019.
˚€−—˛ Respecting the rights of the people working in Eni and for Eni is fundamental to build mutually satisfacto -ry and lasting relationships.
For this reason,  Eni has a constant dialogue with trade unions  and in 2018  it participated in the second meeting on corporate social responsibility in relation to the commitments  undertaken under the  Global Framework Agreement on Industrial Relations .During the meeting, held in Montreux (CH) on December 5 2018, Eni presented the 2018-2021 Strategic  Plan, focusing on employment trends, key performance results and HSE initiatives, as well as Eni™s ap -proach to sustainability issues.

MINISTER FABRIZIO PETRI  PRESIDENT OF THE  ITALIAN INTERMINISTERIAL  COMMITTEE FOR HUMAN  RIGHTS˛˝˙€˛ Interview with the Plenipotentiary Minister Fabrizio Petri who has been President of the Italian Inter -ministerial Committee for Human Rights (CIDU) since 2016.
The CIDU, which aims to fulfil the commit -ments undertaken by Italy in agreements and conventions adopted at international level relating to  the protection and promotion of Human Rights, has allowed Italy to adopt, among the first, a National  Action Plan on Business and Human Rights (BHR).
President Petri, thanks to the work carried out in recent years by the CIDU, Italy now recognizes the  importance of the relationship between business and Human Rights.
In this regard, what role do you  see for large companies like Eni?
In our opinion, the role of large companies is crucial above all for their ability to act as cultural transform -ers in the field of the protection of Human Rights by the private sector.
The voluntary, soft law approach  of the United Nations Guiding Principles and the Italian Action Plan requires that large companies take  the lead, as they can control production chains, but above all because they can set a good example that  stimulates small and medium-sized enterprises to take the necessary steps along the BHR path.
The CIDU is one of the authoritative stakeholders with which Eni has worked in developing its new  Statement on Human Rights and the identification of "salient issues".
What is your impression of Eni™s  track record in the field of Human Rights?
The Statement seemed well structured to us and it brings out Eni™s commitment and clearly underlines  its priorities.
On behalf of the CIDU, I would like to express our hope that over time you will be able to fur -ther strengthen interaction, both at national and international level, with civil society and, in particular,  with Human Rights defenders.
Listening to the demands of the most defenceless groups of the popu -lation and of those most at risk of su˚ering violations of Human Rights, even primary ones, is perhaps  the most important task of large companies like Eni.

In particular, during 2018, Eni™s CEO approved the appli -cation to join the Voluntary Principles Initiative.
Eni has designed a consistent set of rules, processes  and instruments to ensure that:  „ Suppliers of security forces  are selected according to criteria related to Human Rights;  „ The  contractual terms  include provisions on respect for Human Rights;  „ Security operators and supervisors  receive appropriate training;  „ The  events most at risk  are managed in compliance with international standards.
Eni also delivers  training initiatives  and refresher courses  for Eni security personnel  both in the  classroom (for new Security O˝cers) and in e-learning mode.
Thanks also to these courses, the per -centage of the stafi belonging to the Security professional area trained in Human Rights reached 96%.
Since 2009, Eni has been conducting a  training program for public and private security forces at its  subsidiaries in a number of Countries .
It was recognized as a best practice in the 2013 joint publica -tion Global Compact and Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) of the United Nations.
From 2009 to date, training sessions have been carried out in Nigeria (2010), in Pakistan and Iraq  (2011), in the Republic of Congo and Angola (2012), in Indonesia and Algeria (2013), in Mozambique  (2014), in Kenya (2015), in Venezuela and Ecuador (2016), in Nigeria (2017) and Tunisia (2018).

This model enables Eni to  constantly  monitor  its suppliers and to suspend relations if they do not meet the minimum acceptable standards  laid down by Eni.
In 2018, more than 5,000 suppliers were subject to veri˚cation and assessment  on sustainability issues.
For 19% of these suppliers, potential criticalities/areas for improvement were  identi˚ed; in 91% of cases these were not serious enough to compromise the possibility of working  with them.
Furthermore, Eni is involved in numerous engagement activities with suppliers such as: „ Local meetings  with local enterprises, organized with trade associations and/or local authorities, dur -ing which Eni™s values and principles related to sustainability are illustrated; „ Individual meetings  with selected suppliers in the field of  Human Rights assessment , to raise and  create awareness on the promotion and protection of Human Rights; in 2018, 20 suppliers were in -volved, of which 2 from Vietnam, 1 from Ecuador, 2 from Egypt and 15 from Italy; „ Annual events  with the participation and awarding of suppliers who have achieved the best safety per -formance and who have distinguished themselves for their commitment (Safety & Environment Day).
Eni is also committed to  drawing up a code of conduct for suppliers 27, which rea˝rms the importance  of respecting the key principles of sustainability in the supply chain.
Further actions to counter modern  forms of slavery and human tra˝cking and to prevent the exploitation of minerals associated with  Human Rights violations in the supply chain are discussed respectively in the  Slavery and Human  Tra˛cking Statement 28 and in the  Position Statement on ﬁConfiict mineralsﬂ 29.Finally, with more general reference to  Eni™s business partners , speci˚c  clauses on Human Rights  were introduced in 2018 to be included in agreements entered into with Countries and other compa -nies, aimed at representing and binding the parties to act in line with the main international standards  and to exercise a suitable form of leverage on them.
Each business partner is also subject to a prior  audit aimed at identifying the presence of any critical issues relating to the respect for Human Rights  and provide for appropriate measures for their management.

The core of this programme lies in the top level commitment of Eni and the set of  WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO ENI?
Improving the governance and transparency of the extraction sector is essential to promote good use of resources and prevent corruption.
The repudiation of all forms of corruption has been one of the fundamental  ethical principles of Eni™s Code of Ethics since 1998 and this is why Eni has a system of rules and controls aimed  at preventing corruption (Anti-Corruption Compliance Program).

Since 2010, the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program has been implemented by  a dedicated organisational structure (Anti-Corruption Unit) which is responsible  for providing specialist anti-corruption assistance to Eni and its subsidiaries.
In  order to prevent possible critical situations, the Compliance Program provides,  among other things, for the performance of anti-corruption due diligence on  counterparties at risk in order to assess their integrity, professional reliability  and reputation.
Another pillar of the programme is  anti-corruption  training  for employees: „ e-learning courses : online courses for the entire Company population; „ general workshops : interactive training sessions carried out on the basis of the  index produced annually by Transparency International (Corruption Perception  Index) and of Eni™s presence in each Country 32;ENI™S ANTI- CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM Key elements of the Eni™s Anti-Corruption  Compliance Program ANTI-CORRUPTION DUE DILIGENCE COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING ANTI- CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE UNIT REGULATORY SYSTEM TOP LEVEL COMMITMENT DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AND CONTRACTUAL REMEDIES 450100 Countries in which Eni organized anti-corruption workshops in 2018 (Number of participants) General workshop Job specific training Countries in which Eni holds training sessions Perceived corruption according to the Corruption Perception Index 2018 of  Transparency International 7770895415767478129137169125748126 372035836946361318341 124 211 368313 6059331Mexico USA Angola Gabon Ghana Portugal Spain Nigeria Congo Germany Italy Croatia Montenegro Ukraine Egypt Iraq Turkmenistan Pakistan Mozambique   * TOTAL PARTICIPANTS IN     ** TOTAL NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS   1,543*1,068 **„ job specific training : training sessions generally provided alongside general workshops and aimed at  professional areas with a specific corruption risk.
In order to optimise the identi˚cation of the recipients of training initiatives, in 2018 a methodology  was developed, to be applied by 2019, for the systematic segmentation of Eni employees based on the  corruption risk (based on risk drivers: Country, position, professional area and number of employees  of the site).
In addition, in order to spread the compliance culture at all levels, an internal communi -cation initiative called "Compliance Tips" was implemented, in which possible risk situations in which  an employee might incur (such as gifts, hospitality and due diligence) were addressed.
Finally, Eni  launched a number of anti-corruption training initiatives for third parties which will continue in 2019.

The  contribution comes from all business decisions  as well as from speci˚c interventions  designed for local development.
Administrations, families and businesses can bene˚t from the efiects  of large-scale or local initiatives.
Investments in new projects and plants in operation are key factors in the development of infrastruc -ture and employment.
Moreover,  agreements to supply gas for domestic consumption or to exploit  gas for electricity production  are powerful growth drivers for the entire local economy.
When a  local  supply chain  is in place, investment can be an efiective lever for growth in economic and human cap -ital.
Where technical and technological skills are mature, local suppliers can take on a primary role  in the collaboration with Eni; otherwise, there may be an opportunity for a transfer of know-how and  growth of local skills.
There is not only an  increase in the number of jobs , but also a shift towards jobs  with ever-increasing value added.
Taken as a whole, the economic system bene˚ts from the positive  impact in terms of taxation and increased spending capacity.
The development of local communities  is also supported by  speci˚c social projects , associated with industrial projects or carried out in ac -cordance with other speci˚c needs of the host Countries, to overcome some of the weaknesses of the  local socio-economic fabric.

This is made possible by:  1. knowledge of the context of the host  Country  from a socio-economic, environmental and cultural  point of view; 2. tools to relate with  local stakeholders  directly and/or indirectly involved throughout the business  cycle to understand their requests, and any grievances, in order to consolidate mutual trust; 3. assessment of the impacts of business activities to identify  critical aspects, opportunities, risks  to local development  from a socio-economic and environmental point of view, including respect and  promotion of Human Rights; 4. definition and implementation of  local development programs  based on international and corporate  standards, in line with the Country Development Plans, as well as with the United Nations 2030 Agenda  and the National Determined Contributions (NDCs - COP21); 5. evaluation  and measurement of the local development generated  ("learn and adaptﬂ).
⁄˙… Grievances are complaints made by an individual Œ or a group of individuals Œ relating to actual or per -ceived impacts caused by the company™s operational activities.
Since 2016 Eni has used  an IT platform  dedicated to the management and monitoring of relations with its stakeholders  (see pp.
14-15) in the  Countries where it operates and handling grievances, in order to guarantee that all suggestions made  by stakeholders are taken on board, provide adequate responses and identify and prevent potential risk  factors.
In 2018, Eni received 193 complaints from 6 subsidiaries/districts 33, of which 72%, or 138 cases,  were resolved and closed.
These complaints concerned the following issues: assessment of community  needs, respect for community rights, systems for monitoring and assessing the efiectiveness of invest -ments in communities, compensation for land loss, assessment of social, economic and cultural impacts  on communities, local content, respect for minimum wages, and respect for Human Rights.

OF GRIEVANCES  RECEIVED HAVE  BEEN RESOLVED  AND CLOSED 72%50˙…˚€−˙€ˆ‰˚˛˝˙Š˝ ˆˆ“˙˛˝ˆ In 2016, the Danish Institute for Human Rights (DIHR) carried out  an assessment on an Eni project in Myanmar before its implemen -tation.
Among the potential impacts on Human Rights that have  emerged, risks of forced labor and other abuses of labor rights have  been identi˚ed.
Particular attention was paid to the most vulnerable  categories of workers, such as contractors.
Despite having noted the  adoption of regulatory and contractual instruments aimed at ensur -ing compliance with international standards on Human Rights, the  DIHR has highlighted, among the areas of particular criticality, the  efiective application of the clauses by the contractors towards their  sub - contractors and the concrete monitoring possibilities available  to Eni.
In response to these challenges, some speci˚c tools were de -veloped, including a checklist for on-shore seismic acquisition aimed  at accompanying the contractor in the management of sub-contrac -tors and in relations with communities and other stakeholders, with  a speci˚c reference to the difierent operational phases.
In 2018, at  the end of the activities, the DIHR carried out a further assessment  (i.e.
follow-up) of the project which con˚rmed that Eni Myanmar has  successfully implemented the mitigation measures recommended  by the DIHR.
The impact study carried out in Myanmar was also reported in the  2018 Annual Report of the Danish Institute for Human Rights, where  the main case studies to which the Institute contributed during the  year are illustrated.
˛˙ˆ Preventing possible negative impacts on the Human Rights and providing for appropriate management measures  is a key aspect of Eni's ap -proach to developing its operations, as well as  informing and contributing to improving access to fundamental rights  among local communities.
For this purpose, Human Rights are considered from the earliest stages of the feasibility assessment of new projects, through integrated stu -dies of environmental, social and health impact related to the activities 34.
In 2018, Eni adopted a  classi˚cation model for business projects  to determine the relative level of risk, based on which appropriate in-depth studies are carried out.
These include the  Human Rights Impact  Assessment  (HRIA), which involves a preliminary study of a project's characteristics and a subsequent engagement with the main rightholders  aimed at verifying the project's understanding and formulating the necessary recommendations to avoid possible impacts.
In 2018, Human  Right Assessments were carried out in Mozambique and Angola, in addition to the HRIA follow-up in Myanmar in 2016, for which Eni availed itself  of the support of the Danish Institute for Human Rights.
Also in 2018, Eni carried out a  mapping of indigenous populations  located in the vicinity  of operations and projects and consolidated the internal methodology for the management of grievances received.

The NGO Technoserve is working closely with the people involved by the project to ensure the continuity  and growth of new businesses established in the area, supporting them through training in business  management and mentoring by expert technicians.
Which are the main challenges faced during the implementation of the project and how are you  addressing them?
As with all projects, we have encountered minor challenges during implementation.
After the instal -lation of starter packs (the physical assets transferred to beneficiaries to allow them to implement  their selected livelihood activity), some beneficiaries started to compare the content of the equip -ment received, and requested for their option to be changed to other options with a perceived higher  value.
To address this challenge, my team and I have spent a lot of time explaining to recipients  the importance of focusing on future revenues streams as the key driver for business growth and  livelihood restoration.
We have been working closely with the local community elders in addressing  these issues.
In addition Eni has supported us to implement a grievance management mechanism  that has proved very useful in resolving any community tensions.

The natural gas available locally at an afiordable price  will ensure a cleaner and more stable and secure energy supply.
To  implement the project, Eni purchased land from the Sanzule Com -munity in the western part of Ghana to build on-shore gas recep -tion facilities from the Sankofa ˚eld.
The acquired area, of about  96 hectares, directly afiected 205 families who were not relocated  but used that land for their livelihood.
PROJECT GOALS  To mitigate the efiects of the project activities, Eni implemented  support activities for impacted families in order to re-establish  their livelihood, through the implementation of the Livelihood Res -toration Plan (LRP) in Sanzule to restore family income generating  activities in a sustainable manner to reach at least pre-project lev -els and improve the living conditions of the bene˚ciaries.
The LRP,  which is part of the broader Environmental and Social Action Plan  (ESAP), was ˚nalised in accordance with international standards,  in particular with IFC PS5 (International Finance Corporation Per -formance Standard Number 5) on land acquisition and involuntary  resettlement, also to ful˚ll the contractual obligations to receive  ˚nancing related to the activities of the business project.
RESULTS AND BENEFICIARIES The LRP programme aims to restore the livelihoods of the families  afiected through: „ Food assistance in the transitional phase;  „ Training program on financial management to ensure proper  management of compensation received as a result of land acqui -sition; „ Activation of new sustainable economic activities (such as: ag -ricultural activities, livestock farming, aquaculture, training and  market access).

Faced with increasingly complex and global events, such as climate change and migratory ˛ows,  Eni has chosen to extend the scope of development projects , overcoming the boundary of the operational  areas through alliances with partners committed on the territory and recognized at the international level  through which the synergic action and the sharing of know-how becomes a driving force for the growth of  communities and Countries of presence in line with the  2030 Agenda .
Partnerships for development represent a strength for Eni to be further developed in order to  share expe -riences, professionalism, knowledge as well as economic and relational resources .
The objective is to  guarantee, through authoritative and internationally recognized partners, technical and methodological  support for the development and implementation of long-term projects, capacity building, training and  awareness of people, evaluation models and monitoring of ongoing activities, awareness on issues of  speci˚c interest.
sARE AN OPPORTUNITY  TO EXPAND THE ROLE  THAT COMPANIES CAN  PLAY IN SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENTﬂ ALBERTO PIATTI,   ENI EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT  FOR RESPONSIBLE AND  SUSTAINABLE ENTERPRISE 5354fi˙˝˙€⁄• The issue of access to energy has always been one of Eni™s priority commitments and this is clearly re -˛ected in Eni™s mission.
Energy is a central element for almost the major challenges and opportunities  that the world is facing today.
Whether it is work, safety, climate change, food production or increasing  income, access to energy is essential.
˙˝ˆ The strategy to bridge social and economic gaps through the development of energy sources is an inte -gral part of the business model.
In this regard,  Eni invests in building infrastructures for the production  and transport of gas for both export and local consumption  so as to generate electricity fostering local  markets development, aware that growing together reinforces the Company™s credibility and opens new  business opportunities as well as consolidates the relationships with Countries.
Over time, this has made  it possible to reach new  local markets  and to  guarantee the energy independence  of Countries, which is  a prerequisite for economic growth.
For example, in Libya Eni supplies almost all the gas needed by the  power plants and in Egypt, where the entire production of gas already remains in the Country thanks to  the discovery of the Zohr ˚eld, the conditions for energy independence will be created.
Overall, Eni, as operator, supplies the domestic markets in  17 Countries  thanks to a supply of  60 bil -lion cubic metres  of natural gas in 2018.
Speci˚cally, in 11 Countries Eni sells its entire production to  supply the local market.
fi˚˛ˆ˙€˚˝ In Africa,  Eni invests in the construction of thermal power stations by using the associated gas  which was  traditionally used to be ˛ared to diversify the energy mix (50% biomass and coal) by introducing a cleaner  source such as natural gas.
To date, Eni has invested a total of approximately  $2 billion  in Sub-Saharan Africa  in the  construction and restoration of networks and power plants in Nigeria and in Congo  (CEC and CED  power plants), with a signi˚cant reduction of gas ˛aring in both Countries.
In Nigeria, the  Okpai power plant  has an installed capacity of 480 MW and has generated about 35,000 GWh of energy (about 8-12% of the  Country™s capacity) since 2005.
In 2019, it is expected to double its installed power capacity to reach about  1 GW, making it one of the largest combined cycle plants with low environmental impact and high e˝ciency.
In addition, the  Congo power plant (CEC) , built as a result of an agreement between Eni and the  Republic of Congo, is the Country™s main producer of electricity.

To date, with two  gas turbines and a capacity of 314 MW, the  CEC covers three-quarters of the energy demand of the  local population .
Eni has started a new investment that provides for the installation of a third 170  MW turbine (scheduled to go into operation at the end of 2019), whose additional gas supply will be  ensured by the Marine XII block operated by Eni and which will allow the CEC to increase its capacity  up to 484 MW.
˙fifi˙€˚–˙fi˝ˆ €˙™˚˛⁄˚ In 2018, a local analysis was carried out with the aim of measuring  the social, economic and environmental impacts of the CEC on the  Pointe-Noire community.
The data was collected in the ˚eld through interviews and struc -tured according to the Eni Impact Tool* methodology validated  by the Politecnico di Milano.
The survey involved domestic users  (about 1,000 families), 42 schools, 28 hospitals and 380 produc -tion and commercial businesses.
In the 8 years of activity of the CEC, Pointe-Noire has bene˚ted from  the electricity supply, ensuring greater access to electricity for the  city™s inhabitants, as con˚rmed by the evaluation conducted.
The  analysis, through the Eni Impact Tool, has made it possible to as -sess the overall ﬁqualityﬂ of access to electricity (such as continui -ty of supply and voltage stability) as well as impacts related to the  quality of life through speci˚c metrics (natural, physical, human,  social and ˚nancial livelihoods).

˛˝˙€˙‹ 60fi˙˝ˆ Access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation has not only been recognised as a universal, auton -omous and speci˚c Human Right and a prerequisite for all other Human Rights, but it is also a central  element for development.
Eni is engaged in the lands where it is present to facilitate access to water and  improve sanitation conditions by supporting SDG 6, with targeted actions such as the  construction of  wells, drinking water plants, water distribution networks and sewers, as well as training activities .
In February 2018, in Nigeria, Eni and FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) signed a  Collaboration Agreement for the implementation of sustainability activities in favor of communities a˚ected by  the humanitarian crisis in the North East of Nigeria.
The Access to Water project is the first initiative identified  by the agreement, to ensure access to clean and safe water thanks to the construction of wells powered by  photovoltaic systems.
What is the Access to Water project?
In which areas of the Country is it developing and to whom is it  destined?
Which SDGs are addressed by the project?
The "Access to Water" Project is a partnership between FAO and Eni to support the IDP - Internally Displaced Per -sons and the host communities a˚ected by the crisis of the North East - Lake Chad.
This project focuses mainly  at targeting the following sustainable development goals: SDG 1, end poverty; SDG 2, end hunger; SDG 6, guaran -tee everyone the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation; SDG 13, take urgent meas -ures to fight climate change and its consequences.
What were the challenges in implementing the project?
How were they overcome?
Check points and curfews limit the possibility of IDPs to move around and cultivate land.
We are working with the  Institutions to evaluate how to open up the perimeter of land accessible for farming purpose but, at the same  time, without risking security.
In terms of sustainability, we decided to build the wells in areas where IDPs co -habit with existing communities in order to share the benefits also with the stable population, and sensitized  both guest and host communities on the advantages.
Also, we combine water and agricultural support, to see  the quickest way to enhance livelihood.
We've given fast maturing vegetable seeds for them to be able to grow  quickly using this water, therefore integrating both their diet and their sources of income.
What impact does it have on local populations?
What feedback do you get from beneficiaries and  stakeholders?
The impacts of water being available are numerous: first of all the possibility of having access to water without  having to travel for miles to get it.
This reduces the risk of people stepping on mines and being attacked when  they are going to collect water.
Increased access to clean and safe water also allows the development of agricul -ture and the reduction of diseases transmitted by contaminated water.

The crisis has triggered important migration ˛ows in the  Country and the development of informal settlements both in Abu -ja and in the North East where many ˛eeing people are pouring in.
In this context, the Federal Government of Nigeria has requested  support from energy companies and Eni has signed a three-year  Collaboration Agreement with FAO.
PROJECT GOALS Eni will promote access to clean and safe water in Nigeria through  the construction of wells powered by photovoltaic systems, for  domestic use and for irrigation.
FAO will provide support for the  identi˚cation of areas of intervention, technical support and know- how, as well as training in the sustainable use and maintenance  of facilities.
RESULTS AND BENEFICIARIES „ First well in Waru (Abuja) with a 25,000 litre tank,  equipped with a reverse osmosis treatment plant, which guaran -tees the potability of the water;  „ 3 water collection points with 6 taps each, located in  strategic points of the site to ensure maximum ease  of access;  „ About 4,000 people reached, including IDPs and local communities; „ 4 wells in the Borno State, respectively in the Local Government  Areas of Chibok, Biu, Damboa and Bama.
˙˛˝˙ˆ 6.a By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-build -ing support to developing Countries in water- and sanitation-related  activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalina -tion, water e˝ciency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse  technologies.
13.1  Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to  climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all Countries.
As part of the Eni and FAO collaboration agreement, signed in February 2018, FAO will provide support for the  identification of the intervention areas as well as technical support and know-how, while Eni will build water wells  powered by photovoltaic systems.

This objective is pursued through the joint formulation  with local institutions and the implementation of initiatives aimed at: „ creating  greater awareness and empowerment of beneficiary populations  on major public health  issues; „ improving access to renewed or newly established public health services  at various levels of the  National System through activities of competence development and infrastructure adaptation.
The Countries in which interventions are currently concentrated are as follows: Iraq, Congo, Libya, Egypt,  Mozambique, Indonesia, Angola, Pakistan, Mexico and Italy.
˛˙˝€˛˝€ CONTEXT During 2018, Iraqi authorities asked Eni to support the Health Di -rectorate of the Governorate of Basra (Al Basra, where 2.5 million  inhabitants live) in developing the specialist services of reference  of the local Health System, adapting them to international stand -ards and to the growing regional demand.
PROJECT GOALS 1) To improve oncological diagnostics through the establishment  of the Nuclear Medicine Unit at the Al Sadr University Hospital in  Basra (with the direct participation of Niguarda Hospital in Mi -lan).
The project is planned to last 2 years, with an Eni invest -ment of about •7.2 million.
2) To strengthen (in collaboration with the ﬁGiannina Gasliniﬂ Paediat -ric Hospital, Genoa) the Oncohaematology and Surgery Services  of the Paediatric Hospital of Basra, improving both its infrastruc -ture and diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities.
The initiative is  planned to last 2 years, with a budget of about •3.3 million.
RESULTS AND BENEFICIARIES:  1) Supply activities have been started for the Nuclear Medicine ser -vices to: - acquire equipment and systems;  - build the infrastructure that will house the equipment.
2) The results of the project on the consolidation of the Oncohaema -tology and Surgery services include: - an initial intervention to restore the systems and facilities  necessary for the hospital to fully operate;  - a supply of urgent equipment and materials and essential  medicines; - a programme of technical assistance and on-the-job training  for Iraqi doctors and paramedics through missions to Italy at  the Gaslini Hospital and vice versa;  - a remote service (video conference, telemedicine) to support di -agnostics and treatment of complex cases by the Gaslini Hospital.

Moreover, Eni  measures the socio-economic value brought by its operations , analyses  and monitors the  social bene˚t generated by investments  through speci˚c instruments, such as the Eni  Impact Tool and the Local Content Evaluation Model (ELCE).
˙˛˝ ˚—€˚–˙fi˝ˆ Eni has developed a  method for evaluating the social, economic and environmental impacts  of its ac -tivities locally in order to  quantify the bene˚ts generated and better direct future initiatives .
The Eni  Impact Tool, validated by the  Politecnico di Milano , uses difierent methodologies to measure the change  generated by a project on living conditions and resources of local communities and to assess their eco -nomic and environmental performance.
The model is based on internationally recognised methodologies  already used by entities such as the World Bank and in initiatives linked to the achievement of SDG 7 such  as SEforALL.
The impact at local level is assessed through the development of questionnaires and their  administration in the contexts of intervention; at the same time, macroeconomic studies using public  databases allow the impact analysis to be extended to a broader, national and global scale (for more  information about the application of the model, see p. 55).
’ Local Content is the value added brought by Eni to the socio-economic fabric of a host community ; it  represents the way in which the Company, in conducting its activities, can become a driving force for the  development of the local context.
Its use is instrumental to a more efiective planning of activities and  greater support to the socio-economic development of local realities.
To make this value tangible and monitorable, from 2016 Eni has applied its own model, validated by  the  Politecnico di Milano .
The ELCE (Eni Local Content Evaluation) model quanti˚es the bene˚ts gen -erated by activities in terms of GDP, jobs and additional spending capacity resulting from investment  in training.
The ELCE model assesses the  direct e˝ects , on the basis of economic and employment  commitments (purchases of goods and services, taxes paid, labour costs, recruitment of local stafi)  supported by Eni, the  indirect e˝ects  through the application of Keynesian multipliers obtained from  questionnaires ˚lled out by local suppliers and those  induced  by the analysis of variables of the eco -nomic sectors activated by Eni.
In the 2016-2018 three-year period, the ELCE measured the Local Content of OCTP projects in Ghana  (production phase), East Hub and West Hub in Angola (whole life) and the Zohr project in Egypt as well  as of the Italian operating sites of Ravenna (upstream/downstream), Sannazzaro de™ Burgondi (R&M)  and Val d™Agri (upstream).
