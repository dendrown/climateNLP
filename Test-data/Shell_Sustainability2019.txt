Scenarios This report contains data and analysis from ShellÕs Sky  scenario.
Unlike ShellÕs previously published Mountains  and Oceans exploratory scenarios, the Sky scenario is  based on the assumption that society reaches the Paris  AgreementÕs goal of holding the rise in global average  temperatures this century to well below two degrees  Celsius (2¡C) above pre-industrial levels.
Unlike ShellÕs  Mountains and Oceans scenarios, which unfolded in an  open-ended way based upon plausible assumptions and  quantiÿcations, the Sky scenario was speciÿcally  designed to reach the Paris AgreementÕs goal in a  technically possible manner.
These scenarios are a part  of an ongoing process used in Shell for over 40 years to  challenge executivesÕ perspectives on the future business  environment.
They are designed to stretch management  to consider even events that may only be remotely  possible.
Scenarios, therefore, are not intended to be  predictions of likely future events or outcomes and  investors should not rely on them when making an investment decision with regard to Royal Dutch Shell plc  securities.
It is important to note that ShellÕs existing portfolio has been decades in development.
While we believe our  portfolio is resilient under a wide range of outlooks,  including the IEAÕs 450 Scenario (World Energy Outlook  2016), it includes assets across a spectrum of energy  intensities, including some with above-average intensity.
While we seek to enhance our operationsÕ average  energy intensity through both the development of new  projects and divestments, we have no immediate plans to  move to a net-zero emissions portfolio over our investment  horizon of 10-20 years.
Although we have no immediate  plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio, in  November of 2017, we announced our ambition to  reduce our Net Carbon Footprint in step with societyÕs  progress toward the Paris AgreementÕs goal of holding  the rise in global average temperature to well below 2¡C  above pre-industrial levels.
Accordingly, assuming society  aligns itself with the Paris AgreementÕs goals, we aim to  reduce our Net Carbon Footprint, which includes not only  our direct and indirect carbon emissions, associated with  producing the energy products which we sell, but also our  customersÕ emissions from their use of the energy products  that we sell, by around 20% in 2035 and by around 50%  in 2050.
The use of the term ShellÕs ÒNet Carbon  FootprintÓ is for convenience only and not intended to  suggest these emissions are those of Shell or its  subsidiaries.

It has affected so many people  around the world.
Many have lost theirlives.
At Shell, we are doing everything we can to help in the global response to the virus .
We are focused on protecting our staff and customers and supporting communities where we operate.
We are  working to ensure that our operations are resilient so we can continue  to provide energy, helping to power hospitals and supplying fuel for  ships to get goods around the world.
Our chemical plants are  stepping up production of isopropyl alcohol, a key ingredient of hand-  sanitisingliquid.
How this will all unfold in the short term is still uncertain, of course, but as the world battles to overcome what it is struggling with today, Shell  will seek to assist in whatever way wecan.
At the same time, Shell remains keenly aware of the longer-term challenges facing oursociety.
In 2019, demands for urgent action on climate change grew ever louder.
All of society, from consumers, to businesses, to governments,  recognised the need to accelerate global efforts to reduce greenhouse  gasemissions.
Shell shares this sense of urgency.
We continue to take climate action on many fronts, including tackling our own emissions and helping  customers reduce theirs by expanding the choice of lower-carbon  products we offer.
We are working hard to play our part in the global  transition by providing more and cleanerenergy.
But we Ð and society as a whole Ð need to do much more because change is not happening fastenough.
You can read about our progress on helping tackle climate change, and our efforts to meet societyÕs expectations in this area, in the 2019  Sustainability Report.
Of course, we must also work to meet societyÕs  expectations in many otherareas.
Our approach to sustainability can help us to be ultimately trusted, valued and supported bysociety.
LETTER FROM THE CEO BEN VAN BEURDEN CECEOO RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS Sustainability at Shell comes down to threethings.
The ÿrst is running responsible and proÿtableoperations.
We have made progress on improving the safety of our operations since the early 2000s.
This is largely due to more effective standards  and requirements, such as the Life-Saving Rules.
It is also the result of a  stronger safety culture, guided by our Goal Zero ambition to achieve  no harm and no leaks.
But sadly we have not been able to eliminate  all fatal incidents involving Shell employees andcontractors.
Tragically, seven people died while working for Shell in 2019.
This is unacceptable.
We must strive to do more and continuously improve  our efforts to keep peoplesafe.
We are building on our current approach to safety with a more consistent focus on the way people, culture, equipment, work systems  and processes all interact.
Many of our fatalities over the last ÿve  years were due to the complex interaction between these elements.
We need to better understand the gap between how we expect work  will be done safely and how the work is actually carriedout.
We must continue to work to prevent incidents by maintaining protective barriers to improve safety and by providing training.
But we  also acknowledge that people can make mistakes and processes  canfail.
This means, for example, we can train our people to be even better at dealing with the unexpected and on our response in the moment to  avoid the risk of a serious injury.
We want to get to a place where  even if there is an incident, everyone emergesunhurt.
We must also operate responsibly to safeguard the environment.
This includes efforts to manage our water use, to respect ecosystems and  to reduce waste related to our operations.
For example, in 2019, we  became a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a  group of major chemical and consumer goods companies.
We also  aim to use 1 million tonnes of plastic waste as a raw material in our  chemical plants by 2025.
And, in Nigeria, we continue to tackle  environmental challenges related to oil spills in places with oil theft or 1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 04Shell 2019 Sustainability Report sabotage of pipelines, as well as illegal oil reÿning.
We also have programmes in place to reduce the number of operational spills over  the long term.
In 2019, we continued to carry out vital work to clean  up Bodo, an area badly affected by oilspills.
Being responsible is also about behaving ethically.
Our employees must show absolute integrity every day.
They must meet the ethical  standards that Shell, and society, expects.
Our standards are set out in  ShellÕs business principles and code of conduct.
We are very clear that  it is not sufÿcient for ShellÕs actions and behaviour merely to be legally  sound.
We must take a broad view that also considers the wider  implications of our commercial choices and our stakeholdersÕ view of  them.
We spent a lot of time in 2019 reinforcing the standard of  behaviour we expect.
For example, all senior executives completed a  mandatory ethical leadership programme.
I strongly believe all leaders  must set the tone from thetop.
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE The second area we focus on is to help shape a more sustainable  energyfuture.
That is why we are taking action to provide lower-carbon products to help customers reduce their emissions.
These are products that people rely on  to live their lives, in their homes and businesses, and fortransport.
We continue to work towards delivering on our Net Carbon Footprint ambition to cut the intensity of the greenhouse gas emissions of the  energy products we sell by about 50% by 2050, and 20% by 2035  compared to our 2016 levels, in step with society as it moves towards  meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.
In 2019, we set shorter-term  targets for 2021 of 2-3% lower than our 2016 baseline Net Carbon  Footprint.
In early 2020, we set a Net Carbon Footprint target for  2022 of 3-4% lower than our 2016 baseline.
We will continue to  evolve our approach overtime.
We are taking action to achieve this ambition.
In 2019, we continued to offer lower-emission energy products, including natural gas,  biofuels, hydrogen and renewable power.
We increased our  investment in natural ecosystems that produce carbon credits to help  drivers in two key markets, the Netherlands and the UK, to offset their  carbon emissions.
And we increased our use of detection and repair  programmes at our gas production sites to reduce leaks of methane, a  potent greenhousegas.
Of course, the task of tackling climate change is bigger than any single company.
Everyone on the planet, from consumers, to  businesses, to governments, must play their part in reducing  greenhouse gas emissions.
Everyone must work together.
One form of  collaboration is for businesses like Shell, which supply energy, to work  alongside businesses that use energy, to decarbonise their sector.
The  shipping industry is one sector where such an approach could have a  huge impact.
For example, the Getting to Zero Coalition brings  together more than 90 companies to ÿnd a way to put a commercially  viable net-zero emissions ship to sea by2030.
CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY  The third area of sustainability for us Ð and it is a critical one Ð is to  make a positive contribution tosociety.
Meeting societyÕs expectations involves playing a positive role in communities where we operate and in wider society.
We do this by  creating jobs, developing talent and using local suppliers.
We also  invest in education programmes to equip young aspiring engineers and  scientists with the tools and skills needed to become futureinnovators.
In 2019, we made further progress in providing energy to people who would otherwise go without basics such as electric lighting.
We made  several investments to help provide reliable electricity across Africa,  Asia and beyond.
This supports the effort to help to achieve universal  access to clean, affordable energy, one of the manyUNsustainable  development goals to which wecontribute.
Contributing to society also means gaining and maintaining peopleÕs trust.
We do this by being as open as we can about what we do and  why we do it.
For example, we are being increasingly transparent  about the industry groups we are part of.
In 2019, we published the  Industry Associations Climate Review, which assessed for the ÿrst time  ShellÕs alignment with 19 industry associations on climate-related  policy.
We also published our ÿrst Tax Contribution Report in 2019,  which presents ShellÕs approach to tax and explains how our business  activities are taxedglobally.
This Sustainability Report details our activities during 2019.
The report builds on our actions on sustainability and transparency.
We are a  founding member of the UN Global Compact and we also continue to  support its corporate governance principles on human rights,  environmental protection, anti-corruption and better labourpractices.
Once again, I would like to thank the members of the independent Report Review Panel, who help us provide more balanced, relevant  and responsivereporting.
This report shows much progress.
But Shell must further step up efforts on all fronts, from climate change to ethical leadership to greater  transparency.
We must continue to make a real contribution to  peopleÕs lives.
We can only do this by keeping our approach to  sustainability at the heart of the way we dobusiness.
Ben vBen van Beuran Beurdenden  Chief Executive Ofÿcer 1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 05Shell 2019 Sustainability Report ABOUT THIS REPORT TOPIC OVERVIEW The 2019 Sustainability Report, published on April 7, 2020, is our  23rd such report.
It focuses on the key sustainability challenges and opportunities we face and the many ways in which we are responding.
It details our social, safety and environmental performance in2019.
Topic selection The topic selection process identiÿes the sustainability subjects that  were most relevant to Shell and our stakeholders or were prominent  globally in2019.
Each year, we use a structured process to select the reportÕs content.
We engage with various groups and individuals to understand speciÿc  concerns about our business and its impact worldwide, particularly  relating to the environment and society.
We consider the views of  others such as non-governmental organisations, customers, the media,  academics, investors and employees.
We gather opinions and advice  in various ways, including formal and informal meetings, workshops  andsurveys.
This report lists the topics that were a priority for Shell in 2019.
Topics that consistently ranked of higher importance were energy transition and  climate change, business ethics, transparency and corporategovernance.
The main steps involved in selecting topicswere: identify and understand topics that are important to our stakeholders and our strategy; collate the topics identiÿed as of high importance; identify the topics that will be covered on www.shell.com ;consider input from our Report Review Panel to ensure that  coverage is balanced, relevant and complete; and inform ShellÕs Executive Committee of the topics, for its  endorsement.
External voices  Several individuals have shared views on ShellÕs activities in sections  called ÒExternal voicesÓ.
These quotes are intended to give  independent perspectives on our activities.
They come from a range of  organisations in areas such as civil society, academia, contracting and  supply, community leadership, as well as customers and people living  or working near our facilities.
They also reþect some of the different  regions where we operate and some of our businesses and projects.
The views expressed are those of the individual and do not represent  views by Shell.
Contributors are notremunerated.
Reporting guidelines We report in line with guidelines developed byIPIECA, the global oil  and gas industry association for advancing environmental and social  performance.
This report has also been prepared in accordance with  the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option (see GRI index for full details).
We used the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to guide and inform our reporting in our  Sustainability Report and Annual Report, which were complemented  by our Sky scenario and the Shell Energy TransitionReport.

2018 RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUR RESPONSES 2018 RECOMMENDATIONSHOW SHELL RESPONDED IN 2019 UN susUN susttainable deainable devvelopment goals (SDGs): elopment goals (SDGs):Integrate the SDGs more in ShellÕs reporting.
Use the goals more to clearly frame ShellÕs  strategic priorities and to connect the related  steps being taken to meet itsobjectives.
All the SDGs are relevant to Shell.
We can make the greatest contribution to three (see  UN sustainable development goals ).A new interactive table of contents has been added to the reportÕs homepage to direct readers to information related to the SDGs (see www.shell.com/sustainabilityreport ).We have also launched a new SDG page on www.shell.com/sdgs that contains more on our actions to support thegoals.
BalanceBalance::Provide more balanced internal and  external voices in the report.
We continue to include views on our activities, from inside and outside Shell.
Several  individuals have shared their perspectives from a range of organisations, different regions  where we operate and some of our businesses and projects.
We seek to further improve  the balance in future reports by encouraging individuals to provide constructivefeedback.
WWaaterter::Provide additional targets and other  measures Shell uses to minimise water risks for  its operations at the projectlevel.
Water is managed at a local level and targets are not shared in the report.
Case studies  have been provided to give some insight into how water is managed at this local level.
A  new chart has been added to the report to show the source of fresh water that is  withdrawn (see Water use ).PlaPlassticstics::Include more discussion of ShellÕs role  in addressing the global challenge of  oceanplastics.
The report features a number of new initiatives to address plastic waste, run by Shell and  in collaboration with the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (see Plastics ).ApprApproacoach th to suso susttainabilitainability ry reporeportingting::Focus  on integrating ShellÕs strategic priorities under  a clearly articulated sustainability strategy.
This would also enable Shell to produce a  more succinct report with the opportunity for  more in-depth discussion and precise  reporting on progress on strategicpriorities.
The 2019 report organises content under three themes: Responsible business, Sustainable  energy future and Contribution to society.
The commentary and case studies have been  carefully appraised to correlate more closely with the results of the topic selection process  and to reþect our key business decisions.
There remains an opportunity to narrow the  breadth of topics included in the report.
1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 07Shell 2019 Sustainability Report 2019 recommendations letter Report Review Panel statement  The Report Review Panel issues the following independent statement  on ShellÕs 2019 SustainabilityReport.
ÒWe have had the opportunity to review two drafts of the 2019 Sustainability Report and provide feedback to Shell through  conference calls and in writing.
Shell has responded to our questions  and suggestions.
In line with the scope of our review, our feedback  focuses on the quality of ShellÕs sustainability reporting rather than its  sustainability performance.
Following our review of the 2018 Sustainability Report, the Report Review Panel recommended that Shell evolve its approach to its  sustainability reporting with a clear focus on strategic priorities.
We  are pleased to see that Shell has developed a report that is more  concise, clearly structured and puts greater emphasis on sustainability  priorities under its three pillars of responsible business, sustainable  energy future, and contribution to society.
Throughout the report, it is  evident that Shell has sought to address much of our feedback.
We  commend Shell on its continued commitment to transparency and on  reporting its most material sustainabilityimpacts.
Building on the work already undertaken, we see potential for Shell to more clearly articulate how its sustainability priorities intersect with its  core business strategy to drive decisions, such as resource allocation  and prioritisation.
While we value the high level of detail in the report,  Shell could more effectively convey the big picture of its place in  society Ð including both risks and opportunities.
Forming a clear  sustainability strategy would strengthen ShellÕs potential to engage readers who are not sustainability experts but are concerned about  material issues such as climate change and ecological integrity.
Similarly, Shell has an opportunity to demonstrate leadership by  addressing growing concerns about the role that companies should  play in society and to present a point of view on how business can  help address societyÕs most pressingchallenges.
For next yearÕs report, we see potential for innovation in measuring sustainability performance.
We would also like to see Shell continue to  provide more context and explanation for the metrics it already  reports against so that readers are better able to assess changes in  performance and progress towards long-term goals.
We are pleased  to see an emphasis in the report on safety and the steps Shell is taking  to evolve its safety culture.
This presents the possibility to develop new  ways to measure and convey the impact of this change on ShellÕs  safety culture.
We also welcome ShellÕs disclosure on its sustainability-  related partnerships.
We would like to see more information on how  and when Shell pursues such partnerships and how their impact  ismeasured.
Finally, we welcome ShellÕs continued commitment to include more internal and external voices in the report.
We see an opportunity to  further improve the balance of the report by including more diverse  and critical points of view from independent voices and by articulating  in more depth the potential challenges facing key businessareas.
We would like to thank Shell for the opportunity to share our feedback here and throughout the drafting process and we look forward to  reading ShellÕs next sustainability report.Ó 1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 08Shell 2019 Sustainability Report OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY ShellÕs purpose is to power progress together by providing more and cleaner energysolutions.
Our strategy is to strengthen our position as a leading energy company by providing oil, gas and low-carbon energy products and  services as the worldÕs energy system transforms.
Safety and social  responsibility are fundamental to our business approach.
Shell will  only succeed by working collaboratively with customers, governments,  business partners, investors and otherstakeholders.
Our strategy is founded on our outlook for the energy sector and the chance to grasp the opportunities arising from the substantial changes in the world  around us.
The rising standard of living of a growing global population is likely  to continue to drive demand for energy for years to come.
The world will need  to ÿnd a way to meet this growing demand, while transitioning to a lower-  carbon energy system to counter climate change.
While liquid and gaseous  fuels, including biofuels and hydrogen, will continue to be an important part  of the energy mix, over time electricity needs to play a bigger part in the  world if it is to meet the goals of the ParisAgreement.
Technological advances and the need to tackle climate change mean there is a transition under way to a lower-carbon, multi-source energy  system with increasing customer choice.
We recognise that the pace and  the path forward are uncertain and so require agile decision-making.
For more details on our business strategy, see the Strategy and outlooksection in our AnnualReport.
STRATEGIC AMBITIONS We have the following strategic ambitions to guide us in pursuing  ourpurpose: to thrive in the energy transition by responding to societyÕs desire  for more and cleaner, convenient and competitive energy; to provide a world-class investment case.
This involves growing free  cash þow and increasing returns, all built upon a strong ÿnancial  framework and resilient portfolio;and to sustain a strong societal licence to operate and make a positive  contribution to society through our activities.

Sustainability is integrated across our business on threelevels.
Running a safe, efÞcient, responsible and proÞtable business  This is the foundation of our approach.
We strive to produce and deliver  energy responsibly Ð with respect for people, their safety and their  environment.
At the simplest level, this means doing no harm.
We apply  global standards to manage safety, the environment and how we engage  with communities and we work to continuously improve ourperformance.
Helping to shape a more sustainable energy future We provide products that people need and want to improve their lives  Ð in their homes and businesses, and for transport.
We aim to be  responsible stewards for these products.
We intend to adapt, innovate  and play our part in the global shift to provide more and cleaner  energy.
This means transforming our product mix over time.
We are  taking action to provide lower-carbon products to help customers  reduce their emissions.
We aim to reduce the Net Carbon Footprint of  the energy products we sell by around 50% by 2050, and 20% by  2035 compared to our 2016 levels, in step with societyÕs progress to  align with the goals of the ParisAgreement.
Making a positive contribution to society We aim to play a positive role in communities where we operate and in  wider society.
We contribute to the development of local economies by  creating jobs, boosting skills, sourcing from local suppliers, as well as  paying taxes and royalties.
We support community projects that are  based on the needs of local people.
Our ambition is to provide a reliable  electricity supply to100millionpeople, primarily in Africa and Asia,  by2030.
Support for international agreements We welcome theUNsustainable development goals, which seek to  tackle the worldÕs economic, social and environmental challenges by  2030.
We aim to play our part in helping governments and society to  achieve them (see Sustainable development goals ).We aim to respect human rights as set out in the UNÕs Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour OrganizationÕs  core conventions.
We are a founding member of the UN Global Compact  and also support a number of external voluntary codes that promote  responsible business practices.
Read more about these codes at  www.shell.com/sustainability/transparency/external-voluntary-codes .We fully support the Paris AgreementÕs goal to keep the rise in global average temperature this century to well below two degrees Celsius  above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature  increase even further to 1.5 degreesCelsius.

EMBEDDING SUSTAINABILITY INTO PROJECTS Safety, the environment and communities are vital considerations when  we plan, design and operate our projects andfacilities.
We conduct impact assessments for every major project and consider the economic, social, environmental and health opportunities and risks.
The rising standards of living of a growing global population are likely to continue to drive energydemand.
1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 11Shell 2019 Sustainability Report Managing these as well as political, commercial and technical risks is essential to delivering a successfulproject.
We engage with communities and other stakeholders to discuss projects.
Their input helps us to design better projects, comply with relevant social  and environmental regulations, and align with international standards.
This includes standards from the World Bank and the International  FinanceCorporation.
We train our project teams to embed sustainability into projects and aim to balance short- and long-term business interests.
Specialists support our  project teams in areas such as biodiversity, waste, air, energy and water  management, and human rights, including indigenous peoplesÕ rights,  cultural heritage andresettlement.
The mandatory requirements in our Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social Performance Control Framework help to ensure our projects  and facilities are managed safely, responsibly and in a consistentway.
We use our framework for greenhouse gas (GHG) management in projects to evaluate options to drive ourGHGintensity performance.
Our  planning process helps to guide our decisions on technology and whether  to move ahead with a project.
Projects and facilities that produce more  than 50,000 tonnes of GHG emissions a year are required to have a  GHG and energy management plan.
To assess the resilience of proposed  projects, we also consider potential costs associated with operational  GHG emissions (see Greenhouse gas emissions ).We track and report our Net Carbon Footprint and work on reducing the  environmental impact of our operations.
Our Net Carbon Footprint is a  carbon intensity measure that takes into account the estimated full life-  cycle greenhouse gas emissions, including customersÕ emissions, of  theseproducts.
We view our contribution to universal access to energy as fundamental to our core purpose: to provide more and  cleanerenergy.
We work continuously to improve the energy efÿciency of our assets.
This work includes monitoring our electricity use, making our equipment more  efÿcient through regular and smart scheduling of maintenance, and  increasingly by seeking opportunities to use renewable energy sources.
We have also started to collaborate with communities on district heating  and using co-generation power plants at ourprojects.
We aim to work with contractors and suppliers that are economically, environmentally and socially responsible.
The Shell Supplier Principles  outline what we expect from suppliers.
We aim to contribute to the  development of local economies in the regions where we operate by  creating jobs, boosting skills and sourcing from localsuppliers.
We work to play a positive role where we operate.

Governments are responsible for prioritising and implementing approaches that meet the SDGs but achieving these tasks will require  unprecedented collaboration and collective action with business and  civilsociety.
All the goals are relevant to Shell and we have an important role to play in supporting these ambitions.
We can make the greatest contribution to  three goals: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and  modern energy (Goal 7), Decent work and economic growth (Goal 8)  and Climate action (Goal 13).
For information on ShellÕs actions that  support other goals, please visit www.shell.com/sdgs .Globally, around850millionpeople live without access to electricity,  according to the International Energy AgencyÕs World Energy Outlook  2019, and hundreds of millions more are estimated to have an  unreliable supply.
Access to reliable and safe energy is critical to  enabling economic and socialdevelopment.
Our contribution to Goal 7 includes investments in companies that offer innovative energy access solutions, such as solar mini-grids and  solar home systems.
We continue working to achieve our ambition to Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable,  sustainable and modern energy provide a reliable electricity supply to100millionpeople, primarily in  Africa and Asia, by2030.
For more information on our approach, see Access to energy .Employment is a critical route out of poverty and helps people towardsprosperity.
We provide jobs and follow applicable labour, health and safety standards.
We work with governments and others to offer training to  build local skills and expertise.
We encourage local businesses to be  part of our supply chain and seek to ensure our suppliers meet  Shellstandards.
We also support entrepreneurs and help young people start their own businesses through social investment programmes such as ShellLiveWIRE.
We contribute to economic growth by paying taxes and royalties to local governments.
In December 2019, we published a new report  detailing the corporate income tax that Shell companies paid in  countries and locations around the world in2018.
For more information on our approach, see Contribution to society .Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth The world needs to take action to tackle climate change.
The Paris Agreement set a goal of holding the rise in global average  temperature this century to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-  industriallevels.
Everyone in society has a role to play to achieve the Paris goals, and Shell intends to play its part.
We continue to work towards delivering  on our Net Carbon Footprint ambition to cut the intensity of the  greenhouse gas emissions of the energy products we sell by around  50% by 2050, and 20% by 2035 compared with our 2016 levels, in  step withsociety.
We only control the emissions from our own activities, but by changing the mix of energy products we supply, we also aim to help customers  to lower their emissions.
For example, by continuing to increase the  lower-emission energy products we offer, including natural gas,  biofuels, hydrogen and renewable power.
We also aim to invest more  in natural ecosystems to help drivers and businesses offset their  carbonemissions.
For more information on our approach, see Climate change and energy transition .Goal 13: Climate action 1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 13Shell 2019 Sustainability Report PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS This table represents a selection of global metrics that we track within  Shell.
These metrics have been selected because they reþect the direct  impact of Shell companiesÕ operations on people and the environment.
We used them to set our goals and measure progress in 2019 and to  deÿne priorities for2020.
We review our metrics regularly to ensure we capture the information  needed to improve our performance.
For example, we introduced  Goal Zero for personal safety at Shell in 2007.
Since then, we have  broadened the goal to aim for no harm to people and the  environment.
More information on our performance, deÿnitions of the  indicators and the referenced goals is provided in the environmental ,socialandsafety data sections.
GOALS, PERFORMANCE AND PLANS GOAL 2019 TRCFþ 0.7 Achieve total recordable case frequency (TRCF) Ð the number  of injuries per million working  hours Ð of 0.7 or below for  employees and contractors.
Goal Zero has been our ambition for personal safety since2007.
PROGRESS IN 2019 Total recordable case frequency (TRCF) 2100.91.00.80.90.920152016201720182019The TRCF was 0.9 in 2019; the same as in 2018 (seeSafety performance ).PRIORITIES IN 2020 Start to deploy a new approach  to safety with a more consistent  focus on the way people, culture,  equipment, work systems and  processes interact.
In road safety, continue to focus  on effective implementation of  proven practices across all lines  of business, with an emphasis on  improving the management of  fuel transport in high-risk  countries.
Work with road  transport contractors to increase  the use of advanced technology  to support safe driving.
Support the development and  implementation of common  industry safety standards.
Improve our capabilities to learn  from audit ÿndings and  investigations into incidents with  the potential to cause harm.
Leaks þ 115 Reduce the number of operational leaks to 115 or  below (classiÞed as  Òoperational Tier 1 and 2  process safety eventsÓ).
Since 2011, we have extended our ambition of Goal Zero to  processsafety.
From 2017, we combined operational Tier 1 and 2 safety  events when setting the target.
Previously, we only used Tier  1events.
Number of operational Tier 1 and 2 process  safety events 400200022015116612113020152016201720182019The number of Tier 1 and 2 operational  process safety events increased from 121 in  2018 to 130 in 2019 (see Safety performance ).Continue to focus on asset  integrity and quality of  operational execution by, among  other things, shifting attention to  leading indicators to understand  and measure success, embedding  our Process Safety Fundamentals,  and rolling out a group-wide  asset management system.
Continue to improve learning  from process safety events with  high potential impacts.

Effective community feedback.
Enhance our online community  feedback tool aiming to assess  feedback effectively and respond  quickly to concerns, based on the  improvement areas identiÿed in  2018.Identify further improvement  opportunities for our community  feedback mechanism (CFM) based  on a self-check exercise.
Our online community feedback  tool was developed after  completing pilot tests at several  sites.
The new tool provides fast and  mobile access for employees  engaging with communities to help  resolve issues quickly.
Based on an annual social performance assessment, we  identiÿed 31 sites in need of further  assessment of the effectiveness of  CFMs.
For these assessments, we  used a checklist informed by theUN  Guiding Principles for Business and  Human Rights.
Twenty-three sites  implemented CFMs well, with clear  procedures, dedicated employee  focal points and leadership  oversight, and with feedback that  was well understood and  addressed.
For the other eight sites,  we developed improvement plans  primarily to ensure more effective  standardisation for community  feedback across sites.
Introduce the new online community  feedback tool to reduce the  workload for Shell employees and  improve tracking and reporting of  feedback.
Implement improvement plans at  priority CFM sites to enable a  proactive approach.
SOCIAL PERFORMANCE 1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 16Shell 2019 Sustainability Report SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE We have clear and effective governance structures in place  throughout Shell, along with performance standards and other  controls.
These include the Shell General Business Principles, Code of  Conduct and Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social  Performance (HSSE & SP) Control Framework.
These inþuence the  decisions we make and the actions we take at every level ofShell.
The overall accountability for sustainability within Shell is with the Chief Executive Ofÿcer and the Executive Committee.
They are  assisted by the HSSE & SP Executiveteam.
Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee The Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo),  formerly the Corporate and Social Responsibility Committee, is one of  four standing committees of the Board of Royal Dutch Shell plc.
During  2019, the committee reviewed its purpose and updated its terms of  reference to ensure it focuses on areas of most strategic importance  toShell.
The overall role of SESCo is to review the practices and performance of Shell, primarily with respect to safety, environment including climate  change, and broadersustainability.
Visit www.shell.com/sustainability/our-approach/governance and seeourAnnual Report for more on SESCoÕsresponsibilities.
SESComeets regularly to review and discuss a wide range of prioritised topics.
These include the safe and responsible operation of  ShellÕs facilities, environmental protection and greenhouse gas  emissions, major incidents that impact safety and environmental  performance, progress towards ShellÕs Net Carbon Footprint targets  and ambition, and climate change and energytransition.
The committee also endorses ShellÕs annualHSSE & SPassurance plan and reviews the execution of the plan and auditoutcomes.
SESCo assesses ShellÕs overall sustainability performance and provides input into ShellÕs annual reporting and disclosures on sustainability.
SESCo also advises the Remuneration Committee on metrics relating to  sustainable development and energy transition that apply to the  Executive Committee scorecard and incentiveprogramme.
SESCo reviews and considers external stakeholder perspectives in relation to ShellÕs business, as well as how Shell addresses issues of  public concern that could affect its reputation and licence to operate.
Examples include plastic waste, human rights and ethical conduct  andculture.
In 2019, the committee held ÿve meetings in person and three meetings by conference call.
The topics discussed in greater depth  included personal and process safety, ShellÕs Net Carbon Footprint  ambition and the energy transition, and ShellÕs ethics programme.
SESCoalso reviewed Shell companiesÕ operations and the challenges  faced inNigeria.
SESCo conducted one major site visit in 2019 to Singapore.
Over three days, the committee met with Shell employees, contractors,  government ofÿcials, local community leaders and representatives  from local non-governmental organisations to gain a deeper  understanding of ShellÕs business in Singapore.
The committee visited Members of the committee discuss safety and assurance with Shell senior managers during a meeting in TheHague.

The  metrics had equal weighting between ShellÕs safety (10%) and  environmental (10%) performance.
Scorecard measures for 2020 will  remain thesame.
Targets are set each year by the BoardÕs Remuneration Committee, based on recommendations from the Safety, Environment and  Sustainability Committee (previously called the Corporate and Social  Responsibility Committee), with outcomes reported retrospectively in  the Annual Report.
The same annual bonus scorecard used for the  Executive Directors applies to the majority of ShellÕs employees around  theworld.
Read more about the 2019 directorsÕ remuneration in the AnnualReport .
Long-term incentive plan In 2017, we were the ÿrst international oil and gas organisation to set  the ambition to reduce the Net Carbon Footprint of the energy  products we sell (a carbon intensity measure that takes into account  their full life-cycle emissions including customersÕ emissions associated  with using them) in the period to 2050.
We aim to do that in step with  societyÕs drive to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate  change (see Net Carbon Footprint ).We announced plans in 2018 to link executive remuneration to short-  term targets to reduce the Net Carbon Footprint of the energy  products we sell, including our customersÕ emissions from their use of  our energy products.
We accelerated our plans by including an  energy transition condition in the performance conditions for the 2019  long-term incentive plan.
The condition includes the ÿrst three-year  target to reduce the Net Carbon Footprint of the energy products we  sell, as well as other measures that we consider will help us achieve our strategic ambitions in the long term, such as growing ShellÕs power  business, commercialising advanced biofuel technologies and  developing carbon capture and storage (see Business strategy ).
These measures are based on recommendations from the Board's Safety,  Environment and SustainabilityCommittee.
The energy transition condition applied to the Executive Directors, Executive Committee members and around 150 of ShellÕs senior  executives in 2019.
From 2020, we will incorporate the energy  transition condition into the performance share awards made to  around 16,500 employeesglobally.

Our approach applies to all our employees and contractors.
It is informed by theUNUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the core  conventions of the International Labour Organization and the UN  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Human rights due  diligence is embedded into our existing processes and frameworks,  such as the Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social  Performance ControlFramework.
Visit www.shell.com/sustainability/transparency/human-rights for more on our policy and procedures towards humanrights.
Approach to human rights Focus areas Commitment to  human rights Shell General Business Principles Code of Conduct Shell Supplier Principles Access to remedy Labour rights Communities Supply chains Security Community Feedback  Mechanisms Shell Global Helpline and  internal channels Labour rights We respect our employeesÕ and  contractorsÕ rights by working in line   with the International Labour    Organization's core conventions   and the UN Global Compact.
Labour rights include freedom of   association, the right to collective   bargaining, non-discrimination and   equal opportunity, conditions of   work, adequate remuneration and   freedom from forced labour and   child labour.
Communities We manage the impact we may   have on people living near our   operations in line with the    International Finance CorporationÕs    Performance Standards and the UN   Guiding Principles on Business and   Human Rights.
Our Health, Safety,   Security, Environment and Social   Performance Control Framework   expects us to ÿrst avoid or, where   this is not possible, minimise our   impacts on people through project   design.
We work with local    communities to jointly identify    solutions and opportunities.
Security Shell aims to keep staff and facilities   safe while respecting the human    rights and security of local    communities.
We carefully assess   the security threats and risks to our    operations.
We work with    governments and partners to    safeguard assets and provide a    secure working environment for    employees and contractors.
Shell    only uses armed security in countries   where the threats are most severe or   if it is a requirement under local   laws.
Since their development in   2000, companies in Shell have   actively implemented the Voluntary   Principles on Security and Human   Rights that guide companies in   assessing human rights risks when   working with public and private   security organisations.
The Shell Supplier Principles outline   what we expect from contractors   and suppliers in areas such as   human rights.
This includes ensuring   no use of forced, prison or    compulsory labour; no payment of   recruitment fees by workers;    regulations on freedom of    association and collective    bargaining; a safe, secure and   healthy workplace; and the    provision of wages and beneÿts that   meet or exceed the national legal   standards.
We will develop and   strengthen relationships with   contractors and suppliers that are   committed to the principles found on   Shell.com or to similar standards   through their own activities and the   management of their own suppliers   and subcontractors.
Contractors and   suppliers should provide workers   with a dedicated whistleblowing   mechanism where grievances    related to the above topics can be   logged conÿdentially.
Supply chains 1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 20Shell 2019 Sustainability Report Reviewing our progress In 2019, we continued to take steps to seek to improve our approach to  human rights.
This included carrying out an internal assurance review of  the processes and systems in our four focus areas.
We also assessed our  performance in human rights, and employee and contractor welfare in  nine countries.
We have made good progress overall, particularly in  senior management oversight and reporting.
However, the review  identiÿed improvement opportunities in the areas of community feedback  mechanisms, labour rights assessment, training and workerwelfare.
In 2019, we focusedon: assessing our community feedback mechanism against the access to remedy criteria of theUNGuiding Principles on Business and  Human Rights, and implementing improvements (see Social performance data );strengthening our supply chain labour rights assessment through an  initiative with BP, Equinor and Total that aims to create an industry  standard approach to make it easier and more efÿcient for suppliers  to demonstrate how they respect human rights (see Supply chain );updating our human rights training, for employees and contractors,  which we expect to roll out in 2020, improving relevant sections of  the Shell website; and working with our supply chain contractors to ensure our worker  welfare principles are adopted at major construction and  production sites (see Supply chain ).MANAGING OUR IMPACT ON PEOPLE  Indigenous peoples  Our activities can affect indigenous peoples who hold speciÿc rights  for the protection of their cultures, traditional ways of life and special  connections to land and water.
We seek the support and agreement  of indigenous peoples potentially affected by our projects.
We do this  through dialogue and impact managementprocesses.
Shell has also developed a public position statement on Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), a principle recognised in theUNDeclaration  on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
We work to ensure we meet the  requirements of FPIC for governments and companies to obtain the  support of indigenous peoples before starting a project that may  affect their rights.
For example, theLNGCanada joint venture (Shell  interest 40%) was planned and designed by working closely with the  Haisla Nation and six other indigenouscommunities.
In addition to securing support for projects, we look for opportunities to minimise the impact on our indigenous neighbours and their land rights.
In 2019, Shell Canada returned around 0.2 square kilometres of land to  the Aamjiwnaang First Nation.
The land is next to ShellÕs Sarnia  manufacturing facility and was acquired by Shell Canada in the 1960s.
This is the ÿrst time Shell Canada has returned land to its ancestral  owners and is the result of several years of engagement.
The indigenous  community plans to build around 60 homes on theland.
We also help to create employment for indigenous peoples through our local content and skills development programmes.
For example,  Shell Australia has been working with the Wirrpanda Foundation on a  multi-year programme for unemployed Aboriginal job seekers to  improve their physical ÿtness and self-conÿdence and provide training  and networking opportunities.
The programme has so far helped 130  people secure jobs.
Around 80% of the programmeÕs graduates  retained jobs for more than oneyear.
In Canada, we worked with Aamjiwnaang First Nation members to transfer land near the Shell Sarnia Manufacturing Centre back to  thecommunity.
Cultural heritage Preserving cultural heritage is an important part of our efforts to  manage our socialimpact.
Cultural heritage refers to places of archaeological, historical, cultural, artistic and religious signiÿcance.
It also includes unique environmental  features, cultural knowledge and traditional lifestyles that should  bepreserved.
Before starting projects, we develop Òchance ÿnd proceduresÓ to deal with previously unknown heritage resources that may be discovered  during construction.
We aim to ensure these procedures adhere to  industry standards and have mandated them in ShellÕs Health, Safety,  Security, Environment and Social Performance ControlFramework.
We also provide training for inspectors to make them fully aware of cultural resources and give them the authority to halt work  ifnecessary.
In 2019, Shell Pipeline Company LP started construction of the Falcon Pipeline that will connect three major ethane source points in  Pennsylvania and Ohio, USA.
When planning the pipeline, we  engaged with around 1,200 landowners and surveyed about 320  square kilometres to identify sites of archaeological importance.
We  took steps to avoid these sites, such as adjusting the pipelineÕs path  and using horizontal drilling.
This enabled us to protect, among other  areas, a prehistoric Native American site and a residential and  farming complex containing historicartefacts.
In Albania, we commissioned an archaeological ÿeld survey ahead of onshore exploration.
This revealed several sites of historical  signiÿcance, such as cemeteries, mosques and churches, dating back  to the Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires.
As a result, we  identiÿed new target areas for a seismic survey to avoid damaging  these historicareas.
Modern slavery Shell is opposed to all forms of modern slavery.
Such exploitation is  against our commitment to respect human rights as set out in the UN  Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour  OrganizationÕs coreconventions.
We continually work to safeguard human rights in all aspects of doing business and have embedded human rights in our General Business  Principles, Code of Conduct and Shell SupplierPrinciples.
1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 21Shell 2019 Sustainability Report Material for the Falcon ethane pipeline system arrived from Japan on the Clipper Kamoshio vessel into the Port of Philadelphia,USA.
We also expect our contractors and suppliers to respect human rights as set out in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the  International Labour OrganizationÕs core conventions.
In our model  procurement contracts, contractors and suppliers agree to adhere to our  general business principles and supplier principles.
Suppliers are  required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the  country or countries in which they do business and agree to provide and  maintain safe and healthy working conditions for all supplierpersonnel.
Parts of our supply chain may pose higher labour rights risk due to the location and type of goods and services procured.
We carry out risk  assessments combining both these areas.
For location, we use external  indices from risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft to check potential modern  slavery risks.
For types of goods and services, we have identiÿed sectors  where there may be higher risks of unethical labour practices for migrant  workers, such as in construction or maintenanceservices.
Read more about our approach in our statement under the UKModern Slavery Act .
Involuntary resettlement We sometimes require temporary or permanent access to areas of  land or sea where people are living or working.
Where resettlement is  unavoidable, we work with local communities to help them resettle  and maintain, or improve, their standard of living in accordance with  international standards for resettlement (IFC Performance Standard 5).
If necessary, we help support them as they establish  alternativelivelihoods.
For example, Karachaganak Petroleum Operating B.V. (KPO) (Shell interest 29.25%) completed the physical resettlement of 464 families  in north-west Kazakhstan in 2018.
In 2019, KPO focused on restoring  their livelihoods, including working to upgrade houses, provide fertile  soil for growing vegetables and buildplaygrounds.
The North Mindanao Import Facility, ShellÕs largest terminal in the southern Philippines, resettled 83 informal settlers due to noise from the  facilityÕs ÿre-water reservoir and the expansion of the port authorityÕs  berthing area.
The facility worked with local government and non-  government organisations to provide housing and compensation.
Work  to restore peoplesÕ livelihoods was ongoing in 2019; and an  independent review found that resettled families were adjusting well.
Read more about this work at www.shell.com/sustainability/ communities/working-with-communities/laying-the-foundations-for-new-  lives .In the Philippines, Community Coordinator Mark Brazil, met with informal settlers living near an import terminal to discuss their  concerns following a formal public consultation led by the local  government, the Philippine Ports Authority and Shell.
Meetings like  this help to avoid rumours and potential grievancesescalating.
Internal voice MarMark Brk Braazzilil Community coordinator Mark Brazil has worked as a community coordinator for the North  Mindanao Import Facility since construction of the project started in2016.
ÒThe biggest challenge that I personally faced was making sure to do things right.
Delivering a resettlement programme, with the help  of an experienced resettlement advisory team, involves the real  lives of people being directly or indirectly impacted by a project.
A  company with strong adherence to social responsibility will ensure  that impacted households should be given due attention to address  their concerns.
This will result in better well-being.
ÒShell took on this task by cooperating with partners, such as the Philippine Port Authority, which owns the property, and complying  with both local and international regulations andstandards.
ÒWe adopted a collaborative approach involving stakeholders, such as the government agencies, non-governmental organisations  and the village leaders.
We established an efÿcient communication  strategy to coordinate all the different activities.
We engaged in  public consultation, open dialogue and negotiations until we  reached agreement on the new site and the resettlementplan.
ÒEstablishing livelihoods for people remains a challenge due to the distance from their former source of livelihood.
We continue to  work with the resettled families and Pilipinas Shell Foundation to  identify income-generating activities at their newsite.
ÒWe have already carried out consultations and training needs assessments.
We are also working with a local technical school to  help people learn new skills so that they can learn how to generate  an alternative income for their households.Ó 1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 22Shell 2019 Sustainability Report Security We continually seek to improve how we manage security risks to help  protect our employees, contractors, fence-line communities and  theenvironment.
We work to maintain the safety, security and human rights of our employees, contract staff and local communities.
The Voluntary  Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR) are implemented  across Shell where there are identiÿed threats ofinfraction.
We includeVPSHRclauses in our private security contract template and raise the principles in engagements with public security forces.
We carry out annual risk assessments and develop plans to manage  the identiÿedrisks.
Visit www.shell.com/sustainability/transparency/human-rights for more on our approach to human rights and security.Read more about our implementation of the VPSHR at www.shell.com/vpshr .Tackling the cyber threat  Digitalisation and information technology systems play an increasingly  important role in our operations.
As a result, cyber security is central to  managing the risk of data or information loss that could impact our  people, environment andprocesses.
We continuously monitor external developments and share information on threats and security incidents.
Our people are subject to  mandatory courses and regular awareness campaigns to help protect  us from cyberthreats.
We periodically test and adapt cyber security response processes and seek to enhance our security monitoringcapability.
Read more about our approach to cyber security in our AnnualReport .Internal voice MicMichael Bellhael Bell Security manager for Basrah Gas  Company, Iraq Shell provides coaching and mentoring for staff at the Basrah Gas Company joint venture (BGC, Shell interest 44%).
Security staff were trained on the VPSHR as part of a broader skills training programme.
ÒMy security team has worked for many years to maintain a secure  environment for people connected to BGC.
This involved security  and human rights training, including for the Iraqi Oil Police Force,  who are armed police that protect IraqÕs  hydrocarboninfrastructure.
ÒTraining Iraqi BGC guards and the Oil Police Force on the VPSHR posed a real challenge, mainly given IraqÕs ongoing struggle to  balance security needs and human rights.
Part of our approach  was to modify training to reþect cultural norms, for example, using  passages from theKoran.
ÒBGC guard training covered everything from simply wearing correct protective gear to operating access control systems for  people entering facilities, to medical and ÿreÿghtingtraining.
ÒBGC also conducted VPSHR brieÿngs for the Oil Police Force and invested in security infrastructure, including patrol vehicles.
This has  improved safety and security for BGC employees and facilities and  strengthened ties with the Oil Police Force.
It also enables BGC to  monitor alignment with theVPSHR.
ÒAs a result of this, we saw the Oil Police Force de-escalate a potentially deadly dispute recently between farmers who had  exchanged small arms ÿre near the BGC living quarters.
The Oil  Police Force calmly disarmed and escorted the farmers to a police  station.
This is testament to their training in crowd management  and non-lethal response.Ó 1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 23Shell 2019 Sustainability Report SAFETY MANAGING SAFETY Keeping employees and contractors safe is our top priority.
We aim to  do no harm to people and to have no leaks across our operations.
We  refer to this as our Goal Zeroambition.
We expect everyone working for Shell to intervene and stop work that may appearunsafe.
We investigate incidents and aim to learn from them, sharing ÿndings to improve safety performance across ourindustry.
All Shell employees and contractors must meet our safety standards and requirements, including complying with our 12 mandatory Life-  Saving Rules.
Since their launch in 2009, the rules have helped us  make signiÿcant progress in preventing serious incidents, including  many potentialfatalities.
But seven people died while working for Shell in 2019, which is an increase on previous years.
We were deeply saddened by the loss of  these employees and contractors and are determined to learn from  whathappened.
Listed below are the fatal incidents that occurred in2019.
In Nigeria, two contractors died when an oil and gas maintenance vessel they were travelling on capsized in badweather.
A Shell employee died after falling from height into water while a vessel was being moored at ShellÕs Mormon Island facility in theUSA.
A Shell employee based at Convent Reÿnery in the USA was fatally injured in a collision on the road when driving from the airport after his  return from a businessconference.
A Shell employee and a contractor died during a routine and mandatory test of the lifeboat launch and retrieval capabilities at the  Auger tension-leg platform in the US Gulf of Mexico when the lifeboat  disconnected from the lifting apparatus atheight.
A roll-over incident occurred in Pakistan involving a road tanker which led to one contractor being fatallyinjured.
Our safety approach In 2019, the Royal Dutch Shell plc Board and Executive Committee  spent considerable time reþecting on the concerning safety  performance, measured by the number of fatalities, and what needs to  change at Shell to prevent fatalities and all other serious incidents.
This  included carrying out a full review of ShellÕs safety approach, which  covered the effectiveness of current preventative tools, such as the Life-  Saving Rules and Goal Zeroambition.
Since the early 2000s, we have made progress in improving the safety of our operations.
This is largely due to a stronger safety culture  guided by our Goal Zero ambition Ð to achieve no harm and no leaks  Ð and requirements such as the Life-Saving Rules.
Of all the fatalities in  recent years, the vast majority have no link to a breach of the Life-  SavingRules.
But we have not been able to eliminate all fatal incidents involving Shell employees andcontractors.
We are now building on our current approach to safety with a more consistent focus on the way people, culture, equipment, work systems  and processes all interact.
Many of our fatalities in recent years were  down to the complex interaction between theseelements.
In line with one of the Life-Saving Rules, a Shell Canada wells team investigates for dangerous gases to ensure they can safely enter a  conÿnedspace.
1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 24Shell 2019 Sustainability Report We aim to understand better the gap between how we anticipate work will be safely carried out and what happens in reality.
We  continue to work to prevent incidents through maintaining safety  barriers and training, but acknowledge that people can make mistakes  and processes can fail.
We will also focus more on how people can  Òfail safelyÓ, and on our response in the moment to avoid the risk of a  serious injury.
This approach is a philosophical change, which we will  start to deploy from 2020 onwards for all employees andcontractors.
Investigating and learning from incidents Shell requires incidents to be investigated to understand underlying  causes, including the technical, behavioural and organisational  reasons.
We share learnings and take steps to mitigate future incidents  at the site, at the country level and in the wider business.
We aim to  use ÿndings to improve our standard ways of working in  similaractivities.
For example, after a complete investigation of a fatality in Appalachia in 2018, we developed learning toolkits for employees and  contractors.
We held formal conversations about the incident in all  main lines of business and produced a video that received more than  10,000 views.
These steps helped people consider lessons that could  be applied in theirworkplace.
We are also exploring ways to use data analytics to improve decision- making and deliver more targeted learning to employees in  frontlineoperations.
Personal safety performance In 2019, following steady improvements in our safety performance  over the last decade, the number of injuries per million working hours Ð  the total recordable case frequency (TRCF) Ð was 0.9, the same as  in2018.
Total recordable case frequency (TRCF) Injuries per million working hours 2.001.011131815171910121416The level of injuries that led to time off work in 2019 also remained þat  compared with 2018 at 0.3.

It starts with designing and building projects and is implemented throughout the life cycle of the facilities to ensure they are operated  safely, well maintained and regularlyinspected.
Visit www.shell.com/process-safety for more on our approach to processsafety.
Improving risk management Our global standards and operating procedures deÿne the controls  and physical barriers we believe are necessary to preventincidents.
We regularly inspect, test and maintain these barriers to ensure they meet our standards.
In the event of a loss of containment such as a  spill or a leak, we deploy independent recovery measures to prevent  the release from becomingcatastrophic.
We refer to this system of barriers and recovery measures as a bow-tie model, which visually represents a system where process safety  hazards are managed through prevention and responsebarriers.
Risk management approach Threats Consequences TOP  EVENT RECOVERY MEASURES CONTROLS, BARRIERS In 2019, leaders throughout Shell continued to work with their teams  to develop a better shared understanding of process safety challenges  and behaviours, and to jointly design improvements.
We have also  been shifting our focus to leading indicators of process safety to  understand and measure success, rather than focusing just on lagging  indicators, such as the absence of safetyincidents.
Process safety fundamentals Since 2016, we have strengthened barriers that involve critical safety  tasks carried out by frontline staff by embedding a set of 10 process  safety fundamentals across Shell.
They provide clear guidelines for 1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 25Shell 2019 Sustainability Report good operating practice to prevent unplanned releases of hazardous materials.We encourage employees and contractors to use them in  daily conversations to identify safety dilemmas, so they can  beresolved.
Safer wells An example of a safety initiative with a strong process safety element  is the Assist and Assure programme, which aims to ensure that leading  safety indicators are front of mind for our global wells team.
The  programme encourages employees and contractors to take steps such  as scheduling more in-depth discussions before, during and after tasks  and regularly conducting assurance to identify and close safetygaps.
The Shell-operated QGC project in Australia, which produces natural gas for domestic and international markets, improved its safety  performance, recording a 40% decrease in total recordable case  frequency since the programme was introduced in 2018.
QGC  focused on safe drilling, well completion and interventionactivities.
The lessons of the Assist and Assure programme are being shared across different businesses inShell.
Process safety performance In line with industry standards, we measure and report process safety  incidents according to signiÿcance, with Tier 1 as the mostsigniÿcant.
The number of Tier 1 and 2 operational process safety events increased from 121 in 2018 to 130 in 2019, of which 41 were Tier 1 and  89 were Tier 2.For comparison, there were 35 Tier 1 and 86 Tier 2  operational process safety events in2018.
In 2019, the most signiÿcant incident related to process safety was an explosion and subsequent ÿre at the Shell Scotford Complex in  Canada.
The incident was caused by a sudden rise in temperature  within a heater as we were preparing to shut down a section of the  facility.
New heater protection controls were installed to help prevent  this type of incident occurring again.
There were no injuries or health  implications related to the incident.

Executives from Shell and our partners meet with a frontline operational team in Scotland, UK, as part of ShellÕs contractor  safety leadershipprogramme.
RAISING SAFETY STANDARDS Across the industry  We share our safety experience and standards with other operators,  contractors and professional organisations, including the International  Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP), the Energy Institute and  IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for advancing  environmental and socialperformance.
In 2019, we contributed to theIOGPÕs guide to fatigue and driver fatigue awareness campaign, which IPIECA also supports.
We shared  materials developed by our health specialists so they can be used by  others in theindustry.
We worked with the Energy Institute, IOGP and several contractors to launch learning materials, which encourage reþection on how  contractors and clients can jointly manage safetyrisks.
With our contractors We employ a large number of contractors and we work with them to  ensure they understand our safety requirements.
Together, we build  skills and expertise to improve safetyperformance.
For example, we worked with several South Korean and Malaysian shipyards and contractors between 2017 and 2019 to develop common  safety practices.
At one site in Malaysia, all contracting companies  agreed to adopt the common health, safety and environmental  management system of the yard, which helped to deliver a more  consistent approach and a stronger safetyperformance.
Since 2014, Shell executives have collaborated in pairs with executives of major contractor companies Ð as part of ShellÕs  contractor safety leadership programme Ð to identify strategies and  practical steps to improve safety culture and achieve our Goal Zero  ambition of no harm and no leaks.
They also worked to drive  standardisation together.
The programme has a joint safety vision,  which they call a declared future, and includes 19companies.
Together with these contractors, we have signed up to a set of worker welfare principles developed by Building Responsibly, a group of leading  engineering and construction companies (see Supply chain ).PREPARING FOR EMERGENCIES  We seek to ensure we have the necessary resources to deal with spills,  leaks, ÿres and explosions, both offshore and onshore.
We regularly  test our response procedures and capability so we can respond  rapidly to anincident.

In 2019, we trained around 950 employees and contractors on ÿve large-scale oil spill exercises Ð one in Australia, one in Denmark and  three in the USA.
All the exercises involved our emergency response  contractors, joint-venture partners and local authorities to test our  organisational capability to manage a worst-case spillincident.
For example, at the Prelude þoating liqueÿed natural gas facility in Australia (Shell interest 67.5%), a three-day exercise simulated a loss  of well control that resulted in an uncontrolled þow of gas and  condensate (a light oil by-product of gas production).
The simulation  tested procedures to contain the release, such as deploying þoating  barriers and applying dispersant to theoil.
SpillsShell has requirements and procedures in place to prevent operational  spills.
We have routine programmes to maintain facilities and  pipelines, and improve their reliability, to reducespills.
However, spills still occur for reasons such as operational failure, accidents or unusual corrosion.
We investigate and learn from all spills  to improve our performance and aim to clean up the areas around  operations that are affected by spills, irrespective of thecause.
Spills performance The volume of operational spills of oil and oil products in 2019 was  0.2 thousand tonnes, a signiÿcant decrease from 0.9 thousand tonnes  in 2018.
The number of operational spills of more than 100 kilograms  decreased to 70 in 2019 from 93 in 2018.
We have programmes in  place to reduce the number of operational spills over the longterm.

All sabotage- and theft-related spills occurred in Nigeria, except in 2016 (0.001 thousand tonnes) and 2015 (0.005 thousand tonnes).
The number of spills caused by sabotage and theft rose to 156 in 2019 from 109 in 2018.
The volume of these spills increased to 2.0 thousand  tonnes in 2019 from 1.6 thousand tonnes in 2018.
Sabotage and oil  theft remained a signiÿcant cause of spills in the Niger Delta,Nigeria.
TRANSPORT SAFETY Moving large numbers of people, products and equipment by road,  rail, sea and air poses safety risks.
We develop best-practice  standards within Shell to reduce transport safety risks, and work with  others such as specialist contractors, industry bodies, non-  governmental organisations andgovernments.
Visit www.shell.com/sustainability/safety/transport-safety for more on our approach to transportsafety.
In our maritime business, for example, we are working with our contractors to improve the quality and consistency of their safety  management.
This includes developing more effective tools to learn  from incidents and improve behaviours.
In 2019, Shell and contractors  visited more than 4,000 ships to engage mariners on safety and make  the programme moreeffective.
We charter planes to transport passengers, observe pipelines and carry out geophysical surveys.
These planes þew around 13,000 hours  in 2019 forShell.
We used helicopters for about 46,000 þying hours in 2019 to carry people to and from facilities, onshore andoffshore.
In 2019, we worked with offshore helicopter safety association HeliOffshore and the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers  (IOGP) in a number of areas to drive safer ways of working with  aircraft.
For example, we developed a common set of industry  speciÿcations for offshore helicopter þights that includes beneÿts such  as warning systems with earlier hazardalerts.
Road transport remains a challenging and complex area for industry worldwide.
To improve performance, we focus on safe practices and  behaviours and calling for safe vehicledesign.
Road trafÿc accidents claim around1.35millionlives every year, according to the World Health Organization.
In 2019, Shell  employees and contractors drove a combined distance of around  575million kilometres on business in around 60 countries.
There were  two road transport-related fatalities under the operational control of a  Shell company in2019.
We run road safety programmes, such as our mandatory defensive driving course that teaches safe techniques andbehaviour.
In 2019, around 13,200 Shell employees and contractors completed some form of in-vehicle training.
Everyone who drives on public roads  on Shell business also needs to take an annual online defensive driving  trainingcourse.
We also continued to share our safety experience and standards with other operators, contractors and professional organisations.
For  example, as a member of theIOGP, we advocated for its policy that  all members only buy new light vehicles that conform to the highest  globally accepted safety rating, known as the New Car Assessment  Programme (NCAP 5 star).
Shell adopted this policy on January 1,  2019, and is applying it to all our owned, contracted and leased light  vehiclesworldwide.
1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 27Shell 2019 Sustainability Report Transporting fuel In 2019, we continued to implement learnings from a tragic roll-over  incident that occurred in Pakistan in 2017, involving a road tanker  hired by a company that was providing road transport services to  Shell Pakistan Limited.
More than 200 people died after the spilled  fuel ignited as they were collecting it from the incidentsite.
The Royal Dutch Shell plc Board and Executive Committee have launched several improvement programmes to be adopted throughout  Shell.
This includes a road transport risk management initiative focused  on high-riskcountries.
Shell Pakistan Limited continues to work with regulators, emergency services and the wider oil and gas industry in Pakistan with a view to  improving safety standards.
Shell Pakistan Limited is also working with  the road transport industry, including hauliers and retailers, and local  authorities speciÿcally to address driver well-being, fatigue andcare.
In July 2019, there was another tragic roll-over incident in Pakistan involving a contractor road tanker, which led to one contractor (the co-  driver of the truck) being fatally injured.
The investigation report noted  there were improvements in response procedures compared to the  2017 incident.
This included emergency teams arriving on site more  quickly, blocking off the site to avoid people collecting spilled fuel and  a full recovery of the truckÕs remainingcargo.
Eye care for truckers India has one of the worst trafÿc accidents records in the world, with  someone dying on the road every four minutes, according to  government ÿgures.
About a quarter of these accidents involve heavy  commercial vehicles, such as trucks andbuses.
We take the health and safety of our employees very seriously, so all our drivers get their eyes checked regularly.
However, we know this is  not necessarily the case for otherdrivers.
Shell India and social partner VisionSpring are working together on a road safety initiative in India.
The #DriveSafeIndia Eye Camps  campaign provides free eye tests and free prescription spectacles to  truckdrivers.
Internal voice NiNigel Hobgel Hobsonson  VP Trading and Supply Operations ÒShell contractors, distributors and other partners travel around  1.2billion kilometres a year to deliver fuel to our customers.
We  have around 3,000 trucks on the road at any one time.
This is a  signiÿcant safety challenge, especially for fuel transport in high-  riskcountries.
ÒWe focus on several elements to reduce risk as much as possible.
First, we carefully consider fuel transport risks in our business  growth plans.
We contract with professional transport companies  that meet our health and safety standards and requirements, and  that focus on employing competentdrivers.
ÒWe run road safety programmes for our employees and contractors to build skills and to promote the right behaviours.
This  includes running fatigue awarenessprogrammes.
ÒWe work with our road transport contractors to increasingly use advances in technology to support drivers to work more safely.
For  example, we are expanding the use of in-vehicle monitoring devices  with cameras to help provide more targeted coaching todrivers.
ÒWhile we work to minimise the likelihood of incidents, sadly some do occur.
We work with local authorities, specialist contractors and  other partners to improve emergency response.
We also share our  safety standards and experience with the fuel transport industry  and government authorities to help improve road safety  infrastructure and increase industry capability in emergencies.Ó 1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 28Shell 2019 Sustainability Report Eye-testing centres have been set up at truck stops, ports and other transport hubs where truck driverscongregate.
As part of the eye care campaign in India, we found more than two- thirds of truck drivers had never had their eyes tested, with a quarter  unable to see sufÿciently beyond 20metres.
In 2019, more than 120,000 commercial drivers had their eyes tested and 84,000 received free prescription spectacles, mostly on the spot.
The programme aims to reach 365,000 drivers by the end of2020.

Vision screening and  eyeglasses are a simple, scalable intervention with immediate  beneÿt.
With Shell, we are ensuring that drivers and allied  transportation workers can see clearly so that everyone on the  road issafer.
ÒWe have found that 68% of drivers attending the #DriveSafeIndia vision camps have never had their eyes tested before and 69% of  drivers who need glasses are acquiring their very ÿrst pair through  the programme.
With glasses, they can sustain their livelihoods, get  home safely to their families and reduce the risk of trafÿc accidents  Ð one of IndiaÕs leading causes of death andinjury.
ÒOur work together in India is just the beginning of whatÕs possible.
We are looking forward to others joining in this high-impact  initiative.Ó PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP  We work to ensure our products Ð such as fuels, lubricants and  chemicals Ð are safe throughout their life cycle.
Our goal is to protect  employees, customers, communities and the environment from  potential risks posed by these products and to comply with relevant  laws such as chemicals managementlaws.
Good product stewardship means we assess and manage the productsÕ potential health, safety and environmental risks.
We work  with customers and suppliers, monitor changes in the science behind  our products and support research to reduce risks.
We communicate  the potential hazards associated with our products and publish safe  handling information on labels and safety datasheets.
Visit www.shell.com/product-stewardship for more on our approach to productstewardship.
In 2019, we published and distributed more than 346,000 safety data sheets to customers in around 120 countries.
We also follow formal  internal risk assessment processes to identify and manage risks.
In  2019, we carried out more than 600 formal risk assessments for  products andadditives.
We are also preparing for regulations and requirements that aim to create a more circular economy, such as those arising from changes to  waste framework directives.
A circular economy is based on the idea  that things are designed to last longer and to be reused, repurposed  or recycled.
In 2019, we worked to deÿne and establish internal  health, safety and environmental standards for recycling used oil back  into useful motor oils for the market.
Our product stewardship team  has also helped us use recycled plastics as chemicals feedstock for the ÿrst time by assessing risks and assuring regulatory compliance of this  circularfeedstock.
We have technology centres in our three major innovation hubs Ð in India, the Netherlands and the USA Ð with scientists and engineers  conducting vital research into ourproducts.

This means carefully considering the potential impact of our activities  and how local communities and the local environment can be affected  before, during and at the end of ouroperations.
We aim to make a positive contribution to local environments where we operate and continually work to improve ourperformance.
We set ourselves stringent environmental standards, which meet regulatory requirements and often exceed them.
We use external  standards and guidelines, such as those developed by the World Bank  and the International Finance Corporation, to inform ourapproach.
Visit www.shell.com/sustainability/environment/our-approach- sustainability for more on our approach to theenvironment.
We follow global environmental standards for managing our emissions, minimising our use of fresh water and conserving  biodiversity.
Within our operations, we focus on reducing energy use,  þaring less gas and preventing spills and leaks of hazardous materials.
Where necessary, we also clean up and remediate areas impacted by  spills that come from ourfacilities.
We carry out detailed environmental, social and health impact assessments when planning major projects, such as exploration and  drilling activities, offshore platform installation ordecommissioning.
BIODIVERSITY AND SENSITIVE AREAS We seek to understand, avoid and respond to any potential impacts  our activities may have on biodiversity and ecosystemservices.
We use a tool called the mitigation hierarchy in our projects and operations to aim to minimise our impact on the environment as much as possible.
When looking at biodiversity, for example, this means that we ÿrst aim to  avoid impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Where avoidance is  not possible, we aim to minimise our impact.
Where our operations have  affected biodiversity and the communities that rely on biodiversity for their  livelihoods, we seek to help restore impactedhabitats.
We also look for opportunities where we operate to make a positive contribution to conservation, also called net-positive impact.
In 2003,  we made the commitment that we will not explore for or develop oil  and gas resources in natural World Heritage Sites.

Biodiversity management At the Shell Moerdijk chemical complex in the Netherlands, our  biodiversity action plan has helped maintain a variety of þora and fauna.
It has also raised awareness about biodiversity among technical staff.
For  example, in 2019, planned maintenance work was adjusted after  operators found a protected bird species nesting inequipment.
In 2019, we completed the installation of a solar park at Moerdijk.
We worked with scientists from Dutch biodiversity centre Naturalis to study  þora and fauna at the site.
The research found a variety of species,  including 34 bee species of which four are threatened in the  Netherlands.
The study provided insights into the optimum design for  solar parks in relation tobiodiversity.
Biodiversity research at the Shell Moerdijk chemical complex in the Netherlands may help to inform the design of solar parks  morewidely.

While solar panels on roofs and other hard  surfaces are preferred, many solar parks will appear in  ourlandscapes.
ÒAt Naturalis, we provide the knowledge to design and manage solar parks for biodiversity.
With good design and careful  management, solar parks can harbour many plant and animal  species that are in need of more suitablehabitats.
ÒAt ShellÕs Moerdijk solar park, we found many more species of pollinators than can be found on neighbouring agricultural land,  including several threatened and rare species.
This was a ÿrst,  promising step.Ó In Australia, the Shell-operated QGC natural gas producer in Central  Queensland manages the 10,000-hectare Valkyrie property, a large  area of open woodland, to offset our carbon emissions and impact on  biodiversity (see Growing gas and power in Australia ).We also aim to increase biodiversity through reforestation projects as  part of our nature-based solutions business (see Nature-based solutions).We continue to support research programmes to protect life below water.
For example, we are a member of the International Association  of Oil & Gas Producers Joint Industry Programme on Sound and  Marine Life, an initiative to improve understanding of the effect that  sound generated by energy exploration and production has on  marinelife.
WATER USE We design and operate our facilities to help reduce fresh-water use  and tailor our use of fresh water to local conditions.
We carefully  manage our water use and discharges at thesefacilities.
Our impact assessments help us to understand better the water risks for our projects and broader impact on the surroundingwatershed.
We evaluate the long-term sustainability of water resources to select the options that avoid or minimise disruption to the environment and  other users.
We use a combination of tools to help us do this, including  the World Resources InstituteÕs Aqueduct Water RiskAtlas.
Visit www.shell.com/reusing-and-recycling-water to read more about our approach to wateruse.
In 2019, the Pernis reÿnery in the Netherlands concluded a review of how we manage rainwater, cooling and process water at the site.

Waste water and produced water We develop technologies to treat, reuse and recycle water from our  operations.
Where appropriate, we look for ways to treat water from  our operations using natural solutions, such as constructedwetlands.
At the Petroleum Development Oman (PDO, Shell interest 34%) joint  venture in Oman, the Nimr Reed Wetlands project uses a natural  approach to clean the water extracted alongside oil production.
PDO  expanded the wetland facility in 2019, increasing the maximum  capacity of water þow to 175,000 cubic metres a day from 95,000  cubic metres aday.
We track low-level concentrations of oil, grease and other hydrocarbons within water returned to the environment from the day-  to-day running of our facilities (collectively referred to as Òdischarges  to surface waterÓ).
We work to minimise these discharges in line with  regulatory requirements and our ownstandards.
In 2019, the combined total of hydrocarbons discharged to surface water from our facilities was 1.3 thousand tonnes, down from 1.4  thousand tonnes in 2018.
This was mainly due to a decrease in the  amount of oil discharged to water at the Pulau Bukom site  inSingapore.
Soil and groundwater We assess and carefully manage the risks of potential soil and  groundwater contamination.
We conduct scientiÿc research on  potential risks of contamination from petroleum activities and share  our ÿndings with government agencies, researchers and other  stakeholders to support the development of environmentalguidelines.
Water use After treatment,  water is reused or  recycled in our operations,  reinjected into the oil and  gas reservoir, returned  to the environment or  disposed of through  permitted outlets Treatment We treat produced water and waste water to regulatory standards Offshore and onshore production  Reÿning, manufacturing and chemical activities Produced water Produced water is brought  to the surface during the   production of oil and gas Waste water Water that has come into  contact with oil and gas or   chemicals in our operations  is waste water Fresh water consumption We consume water in our  production, reÿning and   petrochemicals operations  Fresh water  withdrawal Fresh water is taken  from surface water,  ground water or  public utilities 1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 32Shell 2019 Sustainability Report The Brent Bravo platform topside was removed by the Pioneering Spirit, a ship stretching the length of six jumbojets.
We helped establish the collaborative soil and groundwater network in Africa called NICOLA (Network on Industrially Contaminated Land  in Africa).
The network comprises energy companies, mining ÿrms,  regulators and academia that share, among other things, the latest  scientiÿc research and technology for managing contaminated land  more effectively.
In 2019, Shell was recognised by the South African  Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries for its leadership in  developing best practice in South Africa, and its contribution to  NICOLA.
Working with others We support open innovation and work with others to improve water  management, includingIPIECA, the global oil and gas industry  association for advancing environmental and social performance.
In  2019, we worked with IPIECA to improve water horizonscanning.
DECOMMISSIONING AND RESTORATION Decommissioning is part of the normal life cycle of every oil and gas  structure when a facility reaches the end of itslife.
Safe and responsible decommissioning is a priority for Shell.
This includes restoring the surroundings of offshore platforms and facilities  in line with relevant legislation, while taking our own environmental  standards intoaccount.
A growing number of oil and gas platforms and facilities are coming to the end of their expected life, having extracted economically  recoverable reserves offshore.
As a result, we have decommissioning  activities under way in Brunei, India, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the  UK and the USA.
We expect decommissioning to increase over the  next fewdecades.
Our largest decommissioning project to date is the Brent oil and gas ÿeld, which lies in the North Sea between the UK and Norway.
Preparation for decommissioning the four Brent platforms Ð Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta Ð started more than a decade ago.
In June 2019, the Brent Bravo topside Ð the part that is visible above the sea  Ð was successfully removed in a single lift and sent for dismantling.
It is  expected that more than 97% will be recycled.
The recommendation  in the Brent ÿeld decommissioning programme is for the concrete legs  (called gravity base structures), which are part of Bravo, Charlie and  Delta, to be left inplace.
Find out more about Brent BravoÕs decommissioning at www.shell.co.uk/top-5-questions-about-brent .Watch the ÿlm at https://youtu.be/D5xXmEHPFp8 .ShellÕs Curlew þoating production, storage and ofþoading vessel was approved for decommissioning in March 2019.
The vessel was towed  to Dundee, UK, in June2019.
In October 2019, the decommissioning of the Goldeneye ÿeld was approved and planning is under way for the removal of the topside  and jacket.
The pipeline for Goldeneye has been preserved to be used  potentially to transport carbon dioxide as part of a carbon capture  and storageproject.
WASTE We aim to reduce the amount of waste we generate.
In our operations  and supply chains, we are also starting to explore a circular economy  approach, which is based on the concept that things are designed to  last longer and to be reused, repurposed orrecycled.
Waste performance In 2019, we disposed of 2,113 thousand tonnes of hazardous and non-  hazardous waste, which is broadly comparable with2018.
In 2019, we sent more than 400 thousand tonnes off-site for recycling or reuse.
Three of our downstream reÿneries sent more than 80% of  their waste generated during the year for recycling or reuse in2019.
Waste disposal thousand tonnes 300002000100011131815171910121416Hazardous Non-hazardous Visit www.shell.com/managing-waste for more on our approach towaste.
We also assessed new waste management software that could help our efforts to reduce the amount of waste we generate.
We worked  with our supplier to conÿgure the system speciÿcally for Shell.
We  have started to implement the system in our Australian business and  plan to roll it out to major facilities across our businesses over the next  fewyears.
Our facilities in Australia have been implementing a number of waste improvement projects aimed at reducing waste to landÿll and  providing beneÿts to local communities.
For example, the contractor  that collects and recycles waste oil from our facilities in rural  Queensland now also collects waste oil from farms during these trips,  allowing this oil to be recycled aswell.
We have also been working to improve the sustainability performance of our buildings by reducing consumption and waste.
For example,  Shell Business Operations centres in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, are  aiming for zero food waste to landÿll in 2020 and have implemented  several waste projects.
In 2019, they reduced total food waste at their  ofÿces by 70%.
1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 33Shell 2019 Sustainability Report We are a founding member of the global Alliance to End Plastic Waste and Shell employees are also taking steps to address plastic  waste.
For example, Shell companies in Nigeria, which use around  9millionsingle-use plastic bottles in their operations each year,  pledged to reduce plastic by 50% in 2020 and 90% by 2021 (see  Plastics ).Shell is looking at options to reduce the amount of material used in packaging by selling products, such as lubricants, in larger packs.
We  use recycled material in packaging where technicallypossible.
PLASTICS We produce chemicals that are the raw materials for plastics and plan  to produce more as global demand increases.
Plastics provide  important beneÿts, helping to improve living standards, hygiene and  nutrition around theworld.
We are ÿnding new ways to reduce the unnecessary use of plastics and recycle plastic waste into innovativeproducts.
Circular economy for plastics In 2019, for example, we announced our ambition to use1million  tonnes of plastic waste as feedstock at our chemical plants by 2025.
This is an important step towards building a circular economy by using  plastic waste to produce chemicals, which can be used to make  plasticsagain.
The ÿrst of our plants to do this in 2019 was Norco in Louisiana, USA.
Our intention is to scale up the technology and deploy it at our  chemical plants in North America, Europe and Asia, gradually  achieving world-scale production by2025.
Read more about using plastic waste to produce chemicals at www.shell.com/shell-uses-plastic-waste-to-produce-chemicals .Watch the ÿlm at https://youtu.be/iTGghtDUlG0 .Ending plastic waste We are a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste,  which intends to invest about $1.5billionover the next ÿve years to  help end plastic pollution in the environment.
The alliance represents a  major effort to minimise and manage plastic waste and to develop  solutions for used plastics by helping to create a circular economy.
To  read about our project to prevent plastic waste from entering the river  Ganges in India, see Collaborations .
You can also visit the Alliance website at endplasticwaste.org .Reducing, reusing and recycling  We also seek to reduce, reuse and recycle packaging across our  supply chains and are exploring different and more sustainable  packagingsolutions.
For example, Shell companies that manufacture lubricants were the ÿrst to create a modern, reusable container for motor engine oil  offered on the Loop shopping platform, which allows customers to buy  everyday products in reusable containers that do not result in waste.
The container is designed to be reused at least 100 times before it is  recycled into new lubricant bottles at the end of itslife.
In our retail operations, we are working to eliminate unnecessary  single-use plastic in our shops and encourage customers and  employees to change from disposables toreusables.
In the Philippines, we are working with Green Antz to transform used lubricant bottles and other plastic waste into eco-bricks, which are  used to build Shell retail sites and, as a next step, affordable houses  andschools.
In 2019, our Norco chemical plant in the USA started using a new type of feedstock, a liquid made from plastic waste.
PRODUCING SHALE OIL AND GAS RESPONSIBLY Shales Ð also known as tight gas and oil Ð will continue to play an  important role in meeting global energy demand.
We focus on  producing shale resources responsibly by following our onshore operating principles , which cover safety, air quality, water protection  and usage, land use and engagement with localcommunities.
Visit www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/natural-gas/tight-and- shale-gas for more on our approach toshales.
We use advances in technology to help make our shales operations safer and more efÿcient, while reducing greenhouse gasemissions.
In 2019, SWEPI LP, a subsidiary of Shell Oil Company, completed the construction of a newly designed shales facility called iShale in the  Permian Basin in West Texas, USA.
The facility is smaller and costs less  to build than traditional shale projects.
This is mainly due to a  production system that more closely combines equipment for drilling  wells with equipment for processing oil andgas.
The facility is also designed to emit 60% less greenhouse gas emissions compared with other shale projects.
This is because it can  operate without gas storage tanks, which require þaring to dispose of  hydrocarbons safely.
Other environmental improvements include using  solar panels and wind turbines to power operations, and infrared  cameras to detect small leaks of methane, a potent greenhousegas.
We aim to take learnings from the design for possible use at our other shalefacilities.
1.Introduction 2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable  energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 34Shell 2019 Sustainability Report Shell's new shales facility has been designed to operate without the need for þaring to dispose of hydrocarbonssafely.
Internal voice Jennifer MorJennifer Morgangan Senior technical safety engineer who worked on the design of the new iShale  facility ÒOne of the ÿrst things you notice at the site is our communications  tower, which enables us to use more advanced camera  surveillance.
The cameras mean we can carry out remote  monitoring in real time, so we can better manage our sites while  reducing the number of miles our inspection teams have to drive.Ó Improving road safety  The expansion of the shale industry in the USA has put signiÿcant  pressure on road networks.
In the Permian Basin, the vast distances  between sites and small rural roads make driving our number onerisk.
As a founding member of the Permian Road Safety Coalition, SWEPI LP continues to work to help ÿnd ways to improve road safety and  reduce the number of trafÿc-related injuries.
We share technology and  expertise, such as the use of in-vehicle systems to monitor and coach  drivers on better behaviour, and educate the public on safedriving.
We are also helping ÿrst responders by providing them with tools and resources to more effectively deal withincidents.
In 2019, we continued to take action to reduce the distances driven by our employees, including opening accommodation at our sites to reduce  commute times.
So far, this has resulted in a reduction of around 23% of  the distances being driven each day.
We have deployed additional safety  measures, such as anti-crash systems in vehicles that can bring a vehicle to  a standstill in the event of anaccident.
We also collaborate with other energy companies to invest in ways to support the demand for roads, health care, education and affordable  housing rising from shaleactivity.

FLARING We are working to reduce þaring, which wastes valuable resources  and contributes to climatechange.
Flaring is used to safely dispose of hydrocarbons that could pose a hazard to workers, nearby residents and facility equipment during non-  routine occurrences.
These occurrences include start-ups, maintenance  turnarounds and power failures where production system pressure  must be safelyrelieved.
Gas produced alongside oil, known as associated gas, may also be þared when there are insufÿcient or no facilities to gather thegas.
As a signatory to the World BankÕs Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative, we continue to pursue our 2015 commitment to eliminate  associated gas þaring atfacilities.
Flaring performance Flaring of gas in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses  contributed around 8% to our overall direct greenhouse gas emissions  in 2019.
Flaring increased to5.9milliontonnes of carbon  dioxideequivalent in 2019 from5.2milliontonnes of carbon dioxide  equivalent in2018.

We subsequently improved controls, and monthly þaring  rates at Prelude fell by more than 60% as the facility moved towards  stableoperations.
In Australia, Shell afÿliate QGC Pty LimitedÕs upstream coal-seam gas facilities also reduced þaring by 80% in 2019 compared with 2018.
In  the USA, þare reduction continued at our Permian unconventional oil  facilities, while in Qatar our Pearl gas-to-liquids plant reduced its  greenhouse gas emissions from þaring by more than 25% in 2019  compared with2018.
Flaring can be used to safely dispose of associated gas where there is no infrastructure to capture it.
In 2019, around 25% of þaring took  place at such facilities, a decrease from around 40% in2018.

These investments include gas-gathering  projects in Oloma, Adibawa and Otumara.
Two key gas-gathering  projects, Southern Swamp and Forcados Yokri, identiÿed for work in  2019, have been delayed and are currently expected to be completed  in2020.
In Nigeria, investments to capture associated gas are helping to reduceþaring.
AIR QUALITY By 2050, two out of three people could be living in cities, and the  number of cars could double from1billiontoday.
The wider use of  electric, hydrogen or natural gas-powered vehicles Ð and more  efÿcient combustion engines Ð can make a major contribution to air  quality.
This is in addition to switching from coal to natural gas-ÿred  powergeneration.
We continue to invest in cleaner ways to power homes and vehicles to improve air quality and make urbanisation moresustainable.

Managing emissions from our operations We take steps to reduce airborne pollutants in our oil and gas  production and processing, for example, lowering emissions of  nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and volatile organiccompounds.
Sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound emissions performance  Our sulphur oxide emissions in 2019 decreased to 65 thousand tonnes  compared with 74 thousand tonnes in 2018, primarily due to divestments  in Argentina, Canada andIraq.
Our nitrogen oxide emissions decreased from 111 thousand tonnes in 2018 to 108 thousand tonnes in 2019, primarily as a result ofdivestments.
Our emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) decreased to 55 thousand tonnes in 2018 from 59 thousand tonnes in 2018, mainly due  todivestments.
Read about Shell's Greenhouse gas emissions .Cleaner-burning fuels ShellGTL(gas-to-liquids) fuel is a cleaner-burning alternative to diesel  which can be used in existing diesel engines without the need  formodiÿcations.
Kroonborg, a maintenance support vessel owned by services company Wagenborg Offshore, is the worldÕs ÿrst offshore vessel to run onGTL.
We also produce cleaner-burningLNGfor use as maritime and land transport fuel.
LNG as a marine fuel, for example, can reduce sulphur  emissions, particulates and nitrogen oxide compared to heavy fuel oil  or marine diesel.
In 2019, Shell Gas & Power Developments B.V.  announced a partnership with Qatar Petroleum to expand LNG  marine fuel availability around the world and opened our second LNG  retail station for trucks in Germany .In 2019, we launched Alexia 40 , a lubricant to help the performance of shipsÕ engines as they move to lower-sulphur fuels that comply with  the new International Maritime Organisationregulations.
Also in 2019, we launched a bitumen product that reduces emissions of speciÿc gases that impact local air quality when asphalt is produced or a road surface is laid.
The new formulation, developed at  our technology centre in Bangalore, India, acts directly with chemical  compounds which are the source of gases such as sulphur dioxide and  nitrogen oxide, particulates and odour-releasingmolecules.
Working with others As a member ofIPIECA, we support theUN-sponsored Partnership for  Clean Fuels and Vehicles, a leading global public-privateinitiative.
Shell continues to look for ways to help improve local air quality.
These include investments in hydrogen fuel technology and electric vehicle  rechargingstations.

We are taking action to tackle our own emissions and to help customers to reduce theirs.
As the energy system evolves, so will our  business to provide the mix of products that our customersneed.
We believe more renewable energy such as solar and wind is critical for a cleaner energy future, and that how people live, work and play is  increasingly going to need to be powered by low-carbon electricity.
But  we expect that consumers will continue to use oil and gas for some time  to come and not all economic activities can be easily, swiftly or cost-  effectively electriÿed.
We see continuing, changing roles for oil and gas  alongside renewable energy, hydrogen and newtechnologies.
We are growing our New Energies business with investments in low- carbon technologies, including biofuels, electric vehicle charging and  wind power.
We are also developing complementary approaches like  carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions to manage  the difÿcult-to-avoid emissions that will remain in the system for years  to come due to continued consumer use of oil andgas.
Addressing a challenge as big as climate change requires a collaborative, society-wide approach.
We believe that smart policies  from governments, such as applying a cost to emissions through  measures such as carbon-pricing mechanisms, supported by effective  steps to reduce emissions from businesses including ours and from  wider society, are the best ways to reach solutions and driveprogress.
WORKING TOGETHER TO LOWER EMISSIONS We continue to work with others to ÿnd ways to lower emissions, both  ours and societyÕs more generally.
We are a founding member of the  Energy Transitions Commission, which brings together leaders  representing a wide range of sectors and interests.
The commission  aims to accelerate change towards low-carbon energy systems that  enable robust economic development and limit the rise in global  average temperature this century to well below 2¡C above pre-  industriallevels.
We work with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), a voluntary CEO-led group that focuses on carbon capture, utilisation and storage  (CCUS), methane detection and reduction , as well as energyefÿciency.
In 2019, the OGCI launched an initiative to unlock large-scale investment in CCUS, with an early aspiration to double the amount of  carbon dioxide that is currently stored globally before 2030.
The  initiative aims to decarbonise industrial hubs around the world, starting  in China, Norway, the Netherlands, the UK and theUSA.
We are also members of the Hydrogen Council, a group comprising CEOs working to raise the proÿle of hydrogenÕs role in the transition to  a low-carbon energysystem.

In 2017, Shell announced a long-term ambition to reduce the Net Carbon Footprint of the energy products we sell.
This is a carbon  intensity measure that takes into account their full life-cycle  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including customersÕ emissions  when they use theseproducts.
By 2050, our ambition is to align our Net Carbon Footprint with the average footprint of the energy mix in the global energy system.
We  aim to reduce the Net Carbon Footprint of the energy products we sell  Ð expressed in grams of carbon dioxide (CO 2) equivalent per megajoule consumed Ð by around 50% by 2050.
As an interim step,  by 2035, and predicated on societal progress, we aim for a reduction  of around 20% compared with our 2016level.
While we seek to enhance our operationsÕ average energy intensity through both the development of new projects and divestments, we  have no immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio  over our investment horizon of 10-20years.
Visit www.shell.com/what-is-shells-net-carbon-footprint-ambition for more on our Net Carbon Footprintambition.
We are building on our long-term ambition with a commitment to set speciÿc Net Carbon Footprint targets for shorter periods.
Shell will set  the target each year, for the following three- or ÿve-year period.
Starting in 2019, we linked these targets and other measures to our  executive remunerationpolicy.
In 2019, we set a target to reduce our Net Carbon Footprint by 2-3% compared to 2016, by 2021.
In early 2020, we decided to set a Net  Carbon Footprint target for 2022 of 3-4% lower than our 2016 Net  Carbon Footprint of 79 grams ofCO 2equivalent permegajoule.
The calculation of the Net Carbon Footprintincludes: emissions directly from Shell operations associated with the  production and processing of energy products; emissions generated by third parties who supply energy to us; our customersÕ emissions from their use of our energy products; and carbon offsets such as reforestation as well as carbon capture and  storage (CCS) emissions reduction.
Also included are emissions from elements of this life cycle not owned  by Shell, such as oil and gas that we process but do not produce, or  from oil products and electricity marketed by Shell that have not been  processed or generated at a Shell facility.
The calculation also  includes biofuels, as well as emissions that we offset by usingCCSor  natural carbon sinks, such as forests and wetlands.
Chemicals and  lubricants products, which are not used to produce energy, are  excluded from the scope of thisambition.
ACHIEVING OUR AMBITION To meet the decarbonisation goals of the Paris Agreement, society  needs an increasing supply of energy products that produce lower or  zeroGHGemissions over their full life cycle, and needs to use those  products more efÿciently and to store emissions that cannot be  avoided in sinks.
Within this framework, our strategy is to keep  increasing the share of such low-carbon energy products in our  portfolio, while also developing carbonsinks.

ÒThe transition to net-zero emissions in the energy sector will be critical.
Leading energy companies can play an important role in  hastening the development and rapid deployment of clean energy  solutions, and in engaging policymakers on the policies that can  accelerate this transition acrosssectors.
ÒTo lead, companies cannot wait.
They must act now to shift investment away from fossil fuels.
ShellÕs actions, such as linking  executive remuneration to climate targets, public positions on  climate policy and its Net Carbon Footprint ambition are  importantsteps.
ÒHowever, Shell must go further to align its investments and targets with the global goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees  Celsius, and to fully leverage its robust inþuence and suite of  resources to help drive the energy transition at a pace  commensurate with the urgency of climate science.Ó By broadening our focus to the full life-cycle emissions from the energy  products that we sell to our customers, instead of solely on our  operational emissions, we believe we will be better aligned with  societal need and growing customer demand for more energy with  lower life-cycle GHG emissions.
Our strategy is to reduce our Net  Carbon Footprint, mainly by increasing the proportion of lower-carbon  products such as natural gas, biofuels, electricity and hydrogen in the  mix of products we sell to ourcustomers.
We are also investing in ways to mitigate emissions through capturing and storingCO 2safely underground, or by planting and protecting naturalecosystems.
In the UK, we have a partnership with Forestry and Land Scotland, the Scottish government agency, to preserve and extend native  woodland in Glengarryforest.
Net Carbon Footprint performance ShellÕs Net Carbon Footprint values between 2016 and 2019 inclusive  are shown in the table below.
We express our Net Carbon Footprint  as the grams of CO 2equivalent per megajoule (gCO 2e/MJ)produced for each unit of energy delivered to, and used by,  aconsumer.
2019201820172016 Net Carbon Footprint  (gCO 2e/MJ)7878797979 The reduction in our Net Carbon Footprint was due to an increase in  sales of electricity in markets with declining grid intensity and growth  in customer demand for carbon-neutral productofferings.
LloydÕs Register Quality Assurance Ltd has provided limited assurance for our Net Carbon Footprint assertion for each year from 2016 to  2019.
Limited assurance means nothing has come to the auditorÕs  attention that would indicate that the Net Carbon Footprint data and  information as presented in the Net Carbon Footprint Assertions were  not materiallycorrect.
While the Net Carbon Footprint is an intensity measure and not an inventory of absolute emissions, a notional estimate of the amount of  CO 2e emissions covered by the scope of the Net Carbon Footprint calculation can be derived from the ÿnal Net Carbon Footprint value  for any year.
Similarly, a fossil equivalent estimate of the total amount  of energy sold included in the calculation can also be determined.
These estimated values for the years 2016 to 2019 are presented in  the tablebelow.

Improving the energy efÿciency of our facilities is one of the ways to help us achieve our Net Carbon Footprint ambition to cut the intensity  of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the energy products we sell  by around half by 2050, in step with societyÕs progress to align with  the goal of the ParisAgreement.
We require projects and facilities that produce more than 50,000 tonnes ofGHGemissions a year to have a GHG and energy  management plan inplace.
These plans help drive our emissions performance through various actions.
This includes using more energy-efÿcient equipment, installing  power from renewable sources and considering carbon capture and  storage in the design of our new and largestprojects.
GHG and energy management plans must include the sources of GHG emissions, as well as a forecast of expected emissions at the site  for at least 10 years.
Projects under development that are expected to  have a materialGHGfootprint must meet carbon performance  standards or industrybenchmarks.
During development, projects are expected to evaluate relevant low- carbon technologies and options to remove GHG emissions.
To assess  the resilience of proposed projects, we consider factors such as  potential costs associated with operational GHGemissions.
We use estimates of future carbon costs that are speciÿc to each country.
This is an important part of our efforts to stay in step with  societyÕs progress toward the goals of the Paris Agreement.
These  estimates were developed using the current Nationally Determined  Contributions (NDCs) submitted by countries as part of the Paris  Agreement.
By 2050, our estimates for all countries increase to $85 a  tonne of GHGemissions.
They are the ÿrst NDCs under the Paris Agreement and are scheduled to be revised every ÿve years.
Therefore, as countries update their  NDCs, we expect to update our estimates too.
Accordingly, we  believe they are a more accurate reþection of societyÕs current  implementation of the Paris Agreement.
TheUNbelieves the current  NDCs are consistent with limiting the average global temperature rise  to around three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
In coming  decades, we expect countries to tighten these NDCs to meet the goals  of the ParisAgreement.
We have also developed and implemented a comprehensive CO 2andenergy management information system that supports our facilities, for example, by analysing real-time data to highlight maintenance gaps  and monitorperformance.
Greenhouse gas emissions performance Our direct GHG emissions decreased from71milliontonnes of CO 2equivalent in 2018 to70milliontonnes of CO 2equivalent in 2019.
The main reasons for the decrease were divestments (for example, in  Argentina, Canada, Iraq, Malaysia, Norway and the UK).
These  decreases were partly offset by the start-up of the Prelude þoating  liqueÿed natural gas facility inAustralia.

When it is released into the  atmosphere, it has a much higher immediate global warming impact  than carbondioxide.
Before methane leaks can be stopped, the sources must ÿrst be identiÿed.
To do this, we use a broad range of methods and  technologies.
These include implementing leak detection and repair  programmes and using the best available technologies Ð such as  optical gas imaging cameras Ð to reduce methane emissions at  oursites.
Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% by 2025.
This target covers all Upstream and Integrated Gas oil and gas  assets for which Shell is the operator.
In 2019, our methane intensity  was 0.08% for assets with marketed gas and 0.01% for assets without  marketed gas.
ShellÕs methane emissions intensity in 2019 ranged from  below 0.01% to 1.3%.
In 2019, we conducted a full leak source inventory at four facilities to improve detection and, at the same time, the accuracy of our  reporting.
At the PearlGTL(gas-to-liquids) plant in Qatar (Qatar Shell  GTL Ltd, QSGTL) we scanned 33,000 components to ensure that any  methane emissions were detected andrepaired.
At a Shell-operated QGC site in Australia, we safely reduced the time spent maintaining the siteÕs 2,600 wells, which resulted in less  methane venting into the atmosphere during work.
This improvement in  procedures reduced methane emissions by around 4,000 tonnes in the  six months from July to December2019.
External voice MarMark Rk Radkadkaa  Chief, Energy and Climate Branch, UN  Environment Programme ÒCost-effective technologies and management practices can  dramatically reduce methane emissions from oil and gas  operations, so itÕs encouraging to see Shell, along with other  companies in the Methane Guiding Principles, making strong  commitments to reduce emissions, take action and report on their  results.Ó In 2019, our operated gas portfolio, including liqueÿed natural gas  and GTL, contributed slightly more than 50% to our overall methane  emissions.
We are currently working with our partners to understand  the methane emissions from non-operatedventures.
Methane initiatives and collaborations We encourage industry-wide action on methane emissions reduction  by participating in a number of voluntary initiatives,including: the Methane Guiding Principles coalition, which we initiated in 2017.
The partnershipÕs growing membership includes major  international and national oil companies and associate signatories  such as the International Energy Agency and theUNEnvironment  Programme; the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative , which has set a methane intensity target for their members of 0.25% by 2025.
This would  reduce collective methane emissions by 350,000 tonnes annually  compared with the 2017 baseline; and the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership , founded by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, whose principles we are using to enhance our  methane emissions reporting.
We have also long supported the direct regulation of methane when  regulation is efÿcient, effective and encourages innovation.
We need  more robust measurement, transparency and management to  successfully reduce methane emissionsglobally.
Methane emissions performance In 2019, our total methane emissions were 91 thousand tonnes  compared with 92 thousand tonnes in 2018, in part driven by  divestments (for example, in Iraq and Canada).
Methane emissions  were less than 5% of ShellÕs greenhouse gas emissions on a  CO 2-equivalent basis.
More than 60% of our reported methane emissions in 2019 came from þaring and venting in our upstream and  midstreamoperations.

We also engage in industry-wide  work on developing more accurate reporting methods, such as  throughIPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for  advancing environmental and socialperformance.
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE We invest in projects to capture and store carbon dioxide (CO 2) andwe are exploring new ways of using CO 2once it has been captured.
These are crucial steps to help us achieve our ambition to reduce the  Net Carbon Footprint of the energy products we sell by around half by  2050, in step with societyÕs drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  as it moves towards the goals of the ParisAgreement.
The majority of climate change scenarios produced by organisations such asIEA,IPCCand Shell require a large component of carbon  capture and storage (CCS) in order to achieve the Paris goals.
We  recognise the scale of the challenge in developingCCSglobally as  quickly and as widely asneeded.
Shell is participating in seven of the 51 large-scale CCS projects globally, listed by the Global CCSInstitute.
Since 2015, we have operated the Quest CCS project (Shell interest 10%) in Canada, which captures and stores CO 2from the Scotford Upgrader.
In its ÿrst four years of operations, Quest captured and  safely stored more than 4million tonnes of CO 2, ahead ofschedule.
In addition to Quest, the Chevron-operated GorgonLNGCCSfacility  in Australia (Shell interest 25%) started operations in August 2019.
Gorgon is the largest CCS operation in the world and, when fully  operational, is expected to capture up to 4 million tonnes of reservoir  CO 2annually.
In Norway, Shell is a partner in the Northern Lights project to develop  ways to transport and store CO 2for industry across Europe.
The aim is to transport CO 2by ship to a central hub and then send it by pipeline to an offshore storage location.
ShellÕs Cansolv technology has been  selected for the CO 2capture at an energy-from-waste plant as part of theproject.
Shell continues to invest in developing CO 2capture technology.
For example, in Austria, our ViennaGreenCO 2project has completed its ÿrst year.
The technology separatesCO 2from þue gases in a lower- cost way (see Developing technology ).In 2019, the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) launched an initiative to unlock large-scale investment in carbon capture, utilisation  and storage, a crucial tool to help society achieve net-zero emissions.
The initiative aims to decarbonise industrial hubs around the world,  starting in China, Norway, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA.
It  focuses on areas that limit the commercialisation such as lack of  investor conÿdence, ÿnancial backing and access to expertise and  dataresources.
Shell, with OGCIÕs investment arm, Climate Investments, and others, is working to develop the UKÕs ÿrst commercial clean gas power CCS  project as part of Net Zero Teesside , an industry partnership aiming to decarbonise a cluster of carbon-intensive businesses by as early  as2030.
The Shell Scotford Complex in Canada consists of a bitumen upgrader, oil reÿnery, chemicals plant and a CCSfacility.
Society will struggle to achieve its climate goals without CCS.
The technology is proven, but more projects need to be built.
Accelerating  the pace of CCS deployment requires collaboration between  governments, industry and investors, among others, to help unlock  ÿnancing capacity, accelerate technology development and  encourage publicsupport.

The  captured CO 2 is separated  from the solvent and  compressed into a liquid form  for transport.
2Transport  CO 2 is generally pumped  through a pipeline, taking the  CO 2 from the industrial site  where it has been produced  to its storage site, which may  be onshore or offshore.
3Storage CO 2 is injected deep  underground into the  microscopic spaces in porous  rocks.
A layer of impermeable   rock, called a cap rock, lies  directly above the porous  rocks ensuring that the CO 2 remains there permanently.
4Measuring, monitoring and veriÞcation  Monitoring of storage sites takes place   within the storage reservoir, as well as at   the injection well, where sensors can detect  small changes in pressure or CO 2 levels.
In addition, a number of monitoring   technologies can be incorporated within   the geosphere, biosphere and atmosphere   surrounding the storage site to make sure   the CO 2 is permanently stored.
The role of CO 2 storage In the IEAÕs Clean Technology Scenario, carbon  capture, utilisation and storage technologies  contribute 13% of the cumulative emissions  reductions needed to 2060.

It is expected to meet around 40% of additional energy demand up  to2040.
Gas will help us achieve our ambition, in step with societyÕs progress towards meeting the Paris Agreement goal, to cut the carbon intensity  of the energy products we sell by around half by 2050, and by around  20% by 2035 as an interim step.
We call this our Net Carbon  Footprint ambition.
It is consistent with the ParisAgreement.
Visit www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/natural-gas andwww.shell.com/providing-more-and-cleaner-energy for more on how natural gas contributes to a lower-carbonworld.
Gas is the cleanest-burning hydrocarbon and produces a fraction of the air pollution that coal does when burned to generate electricity.
Increasing the role that gas plays in the energy mix is one way  countries can take action as the world moves to a low-carbonfuture.
Natural gas is an abundant, secure and readily available source of energy, one of the few that can be used across power generation,  industry, the built environment andtransport.
Gas has signiÿcant advantages when used to generate power alongside renewables, being able to quickly compensate for dips in  supply from solar or wind generation, and rapidly respond to surges in  demand.
Although natural gas emits much lessCO 2than coal when burnt for electricity, this environmental beneÿt is reduced if high levels  of methane are emitted.
Shell is working to reduce methane emissions  through various initiatives (see Methane emissions ).NATURAL GAS NATURAL GAS WWe pre proovvide aride aroundound33% of t% of the whe wororldÕldÕss nanaturtural gaal gass LNG SHIPPING WWe manae manage one of tge one of the whe wororldÕldÕs lars largegesstt  þeeþeetts of LNs of LNG cG cararrrierierss In 2019, gas accounted for around half of ShellÕs total production.

These activities are part of our aim to make power a signiÿcant business for Shell Ð a business that, in the future, could sit alongside  oil, gas and chemicals.
This means being involved at almost every  stage of the power system: from generating electricity, to buying and  selling it, to storing it, to supplying it directly to homes andbusinesses.
Electricity from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, can be combined with the electricity produced from natural gas .
Together, they can provide cleaner sources ofpower.
Read more about our lower-carbon electricity business and solutions at www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/electricity .In 2019, we supplied more than 900,000 customers in the UK with  100% renewable electricity.
Through our Shell Energy Retail business  (rebranded from First Utility, which we acquired in 2018), we supply  renewable electricity as well as natural gas and smart home  technology.
In 2019, we also acquired Hudson Energy Supply UK  Limited, which provides natural gas and renewable electricity to  businesses.
Our renewable electricity is certiÿed by Renewable Energy  Guarantees of Origin, which means that all the electricity customers  buy is matched with the equivalent amount of units from 100%  renewable sources.
In Australia, we acquired ERM Power, one of the countryÕs largest energy retailers for businesses and industry.
ERM will become the  platform for our integrated power business inAustralia.
We also made acquisitions and investments in solar, wind, battery storage for solar-powered homes and renewable energy trading, as  well as charging networks for electric vehicles (see Wind ,Solar ,Distributed and household energy ande-Mobility respectively).
Wind  We are expanding our operations in wind power to make more  renewable power available to our customers.

We also acquired an interest of 49% in ESCO Paciÿc, one of AustraliaÕs most successful solar development and asset management  ÿrms.
The company has delivered nearly 500 MW of solar projects  and has 350 MW under long-termmanagement.
In 2018, we acquired a 43.83% interest in Silicon Ranch, a leading US developer, owner and operator of solar assets.
In 2019, Silicon Ranch  announced the launch of a programme that combines clean electricity  generation with carbon sequestration and ecosystemrestoration.
To help consumers generate, store and redistribute low-carbon electricity, we also bought sonnen, a leader in intelligent energy  storage.
Read more about sonnen in Distributed and household energy .Solar at our sites We are using more solar power at our own sites.
This includes our  ofÿces, retail sites, distribution terminals, reÿneries and offshore  installations (see Energy efÿciency in our operations ).In 2019, we opened one of the largest on-site solar parks in the  Netherlands at our Moerdijk chemical plant and built rooftop solar  installations at seven lubricant plantsworldwide.
Cleantech Solar focuses its solar photovoltaic projects on commercial and industrialcustomers.
Distributed and household energy The power market is more than just delivering electricity to companies  and homes.
Consumers, big and small, are for example starting to  generate their own power through solar panels or wind turbines, store  it for use later and redistribute it where it is neededmost.
Visit www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/electricity for more on our renewable energy solutions for homes andbusinesses.
We are delivering products and services that help meet this changing consumer demand.
We bought sonnen, a German company that  provides smart battery storage and innovative energy services, such as  virtual power plants.
Around 50,000 households and small businesses  across Europe, North America and Australia use sonnenbatteries.
SonnenÕs battery solutions are a safe way to ensure homes are powered with cleaner and more reliable electricity.
Households with  solar and sonnen equipment can store their surplus solar power during  the day and use it at night or when there is a grid power outage.
In  Germany, if customers are short of electricity, they have the capacity  to share surplus solar power of other sonnenusers.
Sonnen also supplies battery storage systems for residential virtual power plants, for example, at the 600 solar-powered, all-electric  apartments at the Soleil Lofts community in Utah, USA.
The local  electricity supplier controls the batteries and can use the communityÕs  surplus solar energy to help manage supply and demand.
This is the  largest virtual power plant of its kind in theUSA.
In 2019, we also acquired the UK power trading company, Limejump, which helps smaller renewable energy generators to get a better  outcome by combining their individual assets into a larger virtual grid.
This enables the renewable energy companies to sell clean power in  real time to the nationalgrid.
How sonnenCommunity works Share  energy Access to energy Goal 7 of theUNsustainable development goals recognises the vital  importance of Òaccess to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern  energy for allÓ in eradicating poverty and protecting the planet.

Farmers in the village grow cotton, wheat and sugar cane.
Irrigation is essential to help cropsgrow.
The initiative helped replace diesel well pumps with a new solar- powered tube well, which more than doubled the water output and  signiÿcantly reduced the time needed to irrigate ÿelds.
This saved  villagers $22 an acre in fuel for each irrigation cycle.
A new solar-  powered þour mill was also installed, meaning people no longer  needed to travel around 8 kilometres to grind their wheat intoþour.
Many families were also able to switch to using cleaner stoves to cook meals.
Previously, they relied on solid fuels for cooking, which ÿlled  their homes with harmful fumes and smoke.
The cleaner stoves were  developed by a winner of Shell LiveWIRE, our þagship youth  entrepreneurshipprogramme.
Further training and a community-owned fund will help the village sustain these improvements successfully over the longterm.
In 2019, Shell invested in solar debt ÿnancing ÿrm Sunfunder that supports the growth of commercial businesses to improve energy  access in East Africa, West Africa and other developingregions.
We are working in India with Husk Power Systems, a mini-grid  company, using a hybrid solar photovoltaic and biomass  gasiÿcation system with battery storage to provide reliable and  affordable electricity 24 hours a day to customers on a pay-as-you-  gobasis.
FUELLING MOBILITY Biofuels  Biofuels are a renewable energy source, made from organic matter or  waste, which can signiÿcantly reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissionsfromtransport.
Biofuels are blended with other fuels such as petrol and diesel.
They can help decarbonise the aviation, marine and heavy-duty road  transportsectors.
We are one of the worldÕs largest biofuels producers through our Ra™zen joint venture (Shell interest 50%, not Shell-operated) inBrazil.
Visit www.shell.com/biofuels for more on our approach tobiofuels.
In 2019, we blended more than 10billion litres of biofuels into our petrol and dieselworldwide.
Turning waste into fuel Most biofuels are produced from agricultural crops, such as corn,  sugar cane or vegetable oil.
Our main focus for biofuels development  and investment is in using waste, inedible crops or forestryproducts.
In 2019, we announced that we will support SkyNRG to develop EuropeÕs ÿrst dedicated sustainable aviation fuel production plant by  bringing our technical and commercial expertise to the development of 1.Introduction2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable energy  future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 51Shell 2019 Sustainability Report the plant.
Once operational, the plant will produce 100,000 tonnes of fuel made from waste cooking oil and will run on sustainablehydrogen.
The combined beneÿts of the feedstocks, sustainable hydrogen and low-carbon energy used to power production are expected to make  the life-cycle carbon emissions of the plantÕs sustainable aviation fuel  85% lower than conventional jet fuels, as estimated by the Roundtable  on Sustainable Biomaterials.
Read more about the plant at  www.shell.com/shell-aviation-supports-skynrg .Together with World Energy, we have agreements with Air France and Lufthansa to fuel their þights from San Francisco International Airport.
The type of sustainable aviation fuel we supply can reduceCO 2emissions by up to 85% compared with conventional jetfuel.
Shell is also a founding member of the Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, which will work together to help make sustainable aviation  fuel widely available.
This means, for example, encouraging blending  of biofuels derived from waste with conventional jet fuel, allowing for a  gradual introduction of the fuel into supply chains without the need to  adapt engines.
The coalition aims to support the ambition to achieve  net-zero emissions in the aviation industry by2050.
In 2019, Shell companies signed agreements with airlines including Lufthansa to supply sustainable aviationfuel.
We are also investing in renewable natural gas in the USA and in Europe for use in natural gas-fuelled vehicles.
Renewable natural gas,  also known as biomethane, is gas collected from landÿll sites, food  waste or manure and then processed until it is fully interchangeable  with conventional natural gas.
In the USA, we plan to expand and  upgrade the JC Biomethane plant in Junction City,Oregon.
Developing advanced biofuels We continue to invest in new ways to produce advanced biofuels from  sustainable raw materials, such as waste and cellulosic biomass from  non-foodplants.
We have a demonstration plant at the Shell Technology Centre Bangalore, India, which features an advanced biofuel process called  IH2, a technology that can turn waste into transport fuel.
The plant can process around 5 tonnes a day of feedstock, such as agricultural  waste, and aims to demonstrate the technology for possible scaling up  andcommercialisation.
Sustainable production Shell aims to have 100% of the sugar-cane ethanol and South  American soy biodiesel used in Shell-blended or traded biofuels  certiÿed as sustainable by 2020.
In 2019, 80% was certiÿed  assustainable.
All the palm oil that we blend is certiÿed by the Roundtable for  Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) or International Sustainability and  Carbon Certiÿcation for feedstocks or covered by offsets from the  RSPO certiÿcate trading system.
We continue to participate in the  RSPO and support its latest set of standards for sustainable palm oil  production adopted in2018.

e-Mobility Shell is exploring how best to meet the needs of electric vehicle drivers  Ð at home, at work or on the road.
We are expanding our charging  networkworldwide.
Visit www.shell.com/electric-vehicle-charging for more on e-mobility.
Shell-owned NewMotion is EuropeÕs largest electric charging company, with more than 60,000 private electric charging points in  France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.
It also provides  around 250,000 users with access to more than 135,000 public  charging points in 35 Europeancountries.
In 2019, we expanded our e-mobility business in the USA by acquiring Greenlots, a California-based company that provides around 5,000  electric vehicle charging points, charging network software and grid  services across the country.
Greenlots also has a growing business in 12  other countries, including Canada, Malaysia, Singapore andThailand.
Fast-charging with renewable electricity Electric vehicle drivers need to top up their batteries much faster  during a journey than when they are at home or work.
We are  growing our Shell Recharge fast-charging service, which is now  available at more than 300 forecourts across Canada, China,  Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, the UK and the USA.
In the  UK, we offer Shell Recharge at sites using 100%-certiÿed  renewableelectricity.
As part of our agreement with charging network operator IONITY, a joint venture of carmakers, we are installing 350 high-powered chargers  at 60 of our biggest highway stations across 10 Europeancountries.

These þuids and greases improve the  performance and efÿciency of thevehicles.
Hydrogen Hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier that can play a signiÿcant role  in the transition to a low-carbonworld.
It has great potential to help meet growing demand for cleaner transport.
When driven, hydrogen vehicles do not emit carbon dioxide,  only water vapour.
If the hydrogen is produced using renewable  energy, the fuel is virtually emission-free.
Shell is helping to build the infrastructure that will be needed if hydrogen is to fulÿl itspotential.
Learn more about how we are developing and using hydrogen to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at www.shell.com/hydrogen Expanding our refuelling network  We are taking early steps to grow a network of hydrogen stations in  Europe and North America, where we are part of several initiatives to  encourage the adoption of hydrogen intransport.
In Germany, through our participation in the H 2Mobility Germany joint venture, we are working with the government and partners to develop a national network of around 100 hydrogen refuelling  stations.
Currently, 82 stations are open, 40 at Shell retailsites.
In the USA, we are working with Toyota and the state of California to open nine hydrogen refuelling stations.
We are also developing with  our partners three new refuelling stations for heavy-duty hydrogen fuel-  cell trucks.
One of these stations will use hydrogen made from  renewablebiogas.
In the UK, we are partnering with ITM Power, a company specialising in  electrolysers, to make hydrogen fuel available at six Shell retail sites.
The  hydrogen is produced on-site using electricity from renewablesources.
WorldÕs largest electrolyser At our Rheinland reÿnery in Germany, we are working with our  partners to build an electrolyser that produces hydrogen using  renewable energy.
The new hydrogen electrolysis plant, which features  advanced polymer electrolyte membrane technology, is expected to  be the largest of its kind in the world.
The electrolyser is designed to  have a capacity of 10 megawatts and produce 1,300 tonnes of  hydrogen ayear.
Our concept for the next generation of retail stations sees conventional fuels being sold alongsidehydrogen.
Energy-efÞcient products Shell V-Power petrol and diesel and Shell Helix engine oil increase  engine efÿciency by burning more cleanly and reducing friction and  wear.
These products lubricate and protect millions of vehicle engines  worldwide everyday.
Shell PurePlus Technology converts natural gas into a pure base oil Ð which can form up to 90% of a ÿnished motor oil Ð to improve and  protect an engineÕs performance.
For example, the technology is used  in the Shell Helix 0W range of lubricants and can help to reduce car  CO 2emissions by up to 4%.
For heavy-duty vehicles, Shell Rimula engine lubricants help heavy-  duty diesel engines reduce friction to improve fuel economy and  therefore reduce CO 2emissions.
Read more about our fuels and lubricants at www.shell.com/motorist We are also developing new technologies that create more durable,  sustainable and energy-efÿcient roads.
Using our clear bitumen in a  light-coloured asphalt, for example, can reduce the need for lighting in  tunnels by up to 40% without affecting drivervisibility.

Our R&D projects often involve collaborations with public or private entities, including universities, government laboratories, technology  start-ups and incubators.
This collaborative approach to innovation  with partners inside and beyond the energy sector helps spark new  ideas and accelerates their development anddeployment.
In 2019, we started work on 223 R&D projects with universities.
Many of these projects focus on areas that are crucial for low-carbon energy  systems, such as biomass, renewable power and  electrochemicalbatteries.
Read more about innovation and collaboration at Shell at www.shell.com/innovation-through-research-and-development .CAPTURING CARBON In 2019, we successfully completed a one-year pilot project to  separate carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the exhaust gases of a biomass power plant in Vienna, Austria.
The project captured 0.7 tonnes of  CO 2per day.The technology meets highCO 2recovery and purity standards and has the potential to cut separation costs per tonne of CO 2by up to 25%, compared to leading alternatives.
We are now working to  develop the technology to commercial scale so we can capture  around 200 times more CO 2.We developed the technology and operated the project in  collaboration with two Austrian universities, TU Wien and the  University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, and six other  partners.
The pilot project and preceding research resulted in eight  PhDs and 15 publishedpapers.
Read more about capturing CO 2inCarbon capture and storage .PLASTIC WASTE AS FEEDSTOCK FOR CHEMICAL PLANTS In 2019, we successfully produced chemicals using a liquid feedstock  made from plastic waste.
The technique, known as pyrolysis, turns  hard-to-recycle plastic waste into chemicals that are used to make new  plastics.
These are the building blocks of everyday consumer goods  like clothing, computers and mobilephones.
This innovation takes us one step closer to our ambition to use1million tonnes of plastic waste a year in our global chemical plants by 2025  (seePlastics ).The technology we developed with universities and others helped capture 0.7 tonnes of CO 2per day at the Austrian pilotproject.
We have completed a project that demonstrates a new carbon  capture process at a biomass power plant inAustria.

For Shell, it is an essential tool that measures the carbon uptake of our nature-based solutions (see Nature-based solutions ) so that we can offer carbon credits to our customerstransparently.
Together with the University of Exeter, UK, we are developing and ÿeld-testing advanced measuring equipment that continuously  monitors the carbon uptake in a naturalecosystem.
The system is small and compact and a fraction of the cost of other systems on the market, while producing accurate data that can be  accessed remotely.
This will allow scientists to deploy more carbon þux  measuring systems and gather more data on ecosystem health and  climate change.
For Shell it provides cost-effective and accurate  measurement of carbon uptake in our nature-basedsolutions.
We work with scientists and universities around the world on research and development projects that focus on, among other  things, low-carbon energysystems.

Ethical leadership In 2019, we built on our ethical leadership expectations programme,  which was introduced in 2018 for all senior executives across Shell.
The programme was designed to reinforce and explore the level of  commitment to ethics and compliance in senior leaders.
It supports the  move in Shell to approach ethics as a topic of personal ownership  rather than a matter of technical compliance.
We launched an online  toolkit to provide material and support for more than 1,000 leaders to  set out ethical leadership expectations in team sessions.
These sessions  are designed to reinforce what Shell requires of leaders, focusing on  values, behaviours, business pressures and leadership, with an  emphasis on ensuring people feel comfortable speakingup.
Speaking up Shell employees, contractors and any third party can report any  potential breaches of the Code of Conduct conÿdentially and  anonymously through several channels, including a global helpline,  which is operated by an independentprovider.
Shell has specialists who investigate concerns or allegations about a breach of our Code of Conduct.
If a violation is conÿrmed, the relevant  Shell company will take appropriate action up to and including a  contract termination or dismissal.
We maintain a stringent no  retaliation policy to protect any person making an allegation in  goodfaith.
Our people are essential to the successful delivery of the Shell strategy and to sustaining business performance over the longterm.

The community feedback mechanisms implemented in our major operations and projects allow us to receive, track and respond to  questions and complaints from community members.
Our network of  around 100 community liaison ofÿcers acts as a bridge between the  local community and thebusiness.
In Berat, southern Albania, our activities increased trafÿc, resulting in dust pollution and health concerns for the local community.
Shell set  up a community centre with a community liaison ofÿcer, who brought  the concerns to the attention of leaders in ShellÕs upstream  organisation inAlbania.
The team implemented three initiatives: trafÿc-calming measures, dust suppression using environmentally friendly chemicals and additional  watering to minimise the impact of dust on local communities.
After the  community centre was set up, the time it took to resolve complaints  decreased from 33 to eightdays.
In 2018, Karachaganak Petroleum Operating B.V. (KPO) (Shell interest 29.25%) completed the physical resettlement of 464 families in north-  west Kazakhstan.
Community liaison ofÿcers continue to use the  community feedback mechanism to address issues related to the new  housing.
In 2019, KPO received 189 complaints and suggestions from  the residents, including requests for additional soil for their back  gardens so that they could grow vegetables.
KPO coordinated the  home repairs and supplied 375 trucks ofsoil.

LOCAL CONTENT AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT Local content is a term we use to describe the ways we contribute to  the development of the countries where we operate, beyond paying  taxes and royalties to governments.
This mainly involves creating jobs,  training people, supporting local businesses and buying goods and  services from localsuppliers.
In 2019, we spent $44.9 billion on goods and services, of which around 65% was in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the UK and  the USA.
In 2019, we estimate around $5.7 billion was spent in  countries that, according to theUNDevelopment Programme Human  Development Index 2017, have a gross domestic product of less than  $15,000 a year per person.
In these countries, Shell companies spent  around 87%, or around $4.9 billion, with localcompanies.
In some countries we support efforts to help more local nationals into  theworkforce.
For example, Shell Oman has helped the Petroleum Development Oman joint venture (PDO, Shell interest 34%) create around 17,000  jobs for local nationals since 2011 as part of a partnership to develop  the countryÕs energyindustry.
In 2019, Shell Oman worked with PDO and other major operators to open up new opportunities for Omanis.
This included using smarter  scheduling of maintenance activities for facilities in a local area so  nationals could access multiple sites more easily from theirhomes.
Our enterprise development and skills programmes create opportunities, while adding value to our supply chain.
We also  sponsor training programmes for people who are not part of ShellÕs  supply chain.
For example, in the Philippines, we support the Bridging Employment through Skills Training programme, which provides vocational training to out-of-school youths and unemployedadults.
Enterprise development ShellÕs LiveWIRE programme helps local entrepreneurs turn their ideas  into reality.
The programme marked its 37th anniversary in 2019 and  operates in 18 countries.
In 2019, we launched programmes in  Canada and the Philippines.
Around the world, Shell LiveWIRE trained  3,079 people and supported 1,269 businesses, while 1,392 jobs  werecreated.
In 2019, 44 Shell LiveWIRE-supported businesses entered our supply chain.
One of these was WormingUp , an enterprise which helps to reduce and more efÿciently recycle waste in Shell retail stations.
Shell  LiveWIRE also supports SheÕKab , a ride-sharing service in Pakistan that uses a digital platform and an app to connect women with security-  checkeddrivers.
HySiLabs , a Shell France-supported company, recently signed up to the Shell GameChanger programme, which works with start-ups and  businesses on unproven early-stage ideas with the potential to impact  the future ofenergy.
Shell has also launched the Shell Startup Engine in partnership with StartupBootCamp.
The programme offers entrepreneurial support,  including coaching and mentoring and access to industryexperts.
In the Philippines, the Shell LiveWIRE programme aims to help coconut farmers ÿnd an additional source of income from the by-  products of theirharvest.

This investment is sometimes  voluntary and sometimes required by governments, or part of a  contractualagreement.
The intent of our social investment programmes is to beneÿt society and the environment where we operate, and also to create a more  positive local business environment forShell.
As well as responding to local social investment priorities, we have three global social investmentthemes: access to energy; science, technology, engineering and mathematics education  (STEM); and community skills and enterprise development.
Social investment programme focus areas are determined by local  community needs andpriorities.
In 2019, we spent almost $173 million on social investment, of which 33% was required by government regulations or contractual  agreements.
We spent $116 million on voluntary social investment, of  which around $60 million was in line with our global themes.
The  remaining $56 million was spent on local programmes for community  development, disaster relief, road safety, health andbiodiversity.
Around $84 million of our total social investment spend in 2019 was in countries that are part of theUNDevelopment ProgrammeÕs Human  Development Index 2018.

In 2019, we made signiÿcant progress in our work with stakeholders in, among other areas, tax and transparency, corporate good practice  and tackling plasticwaste.
Tax transparency In December 2019, we published our ÿrst Tax Contribution Report,  setting out our approach to tax and the corporate income tax that  Shell companies paid in countries and locations around the world in  2018.
The report is part of our commitment to the B Team Responsible  Tax Principles, developed with a group of leading companies, along  with the involvement of civil society, investors and representatives from  internationalinstitutions.
While preparing the Tax Contribution Report, we engaged with several non-governmental organisations and individuals with a strong  interest and expertise in tax transparency.
We sought their views on  best practice and their expectations of an organisation like Shell.
This  provided useful input for our reporting procedures (see Revenue transparency and tax ).Ending plastic waste We are a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a not-  for-proÿt organisation that aims to invest $1.5billionover ÿve years to  help end plastic waste in the environment.
The alliance comprises more  than 40 global companies, including chemical and plastics  manufacturers, consumer goods and waste management companies,  and the World Business Council for SustainableDevelopment.
In 2019, the alliance started several projects, including one in India to stop plastic waste entering the Ganges, one of the worldÕs most polluted  rivers.
The project turns worthless waste into a saleable product by  encouraging local people to collect discarded plastic, which is then  converted into liquid fuel.
We are supporting the project with expertise,  such as hazard identiÿcation, fuel product analysis and qualiÿcation,  and design of the converter facility (see Plastics ).Corporate good practice  In Brazil, we have worked closely with the Ethos Institute, the national  organisation for corporate social responsibility, for more than 20  years.
Shell Brasil PetrŠleo Ltda.
was one of 14 companies in the  country to sign the Guide to Good Practices in Corporate Integrity for  the Oil and Gas Sector.
We are a member of the Brazilian Petroleum,  Gas and Biofuels Institute, which is producing a set of videos to  illustrate the guide, covering topics such as humanrights.
We are a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a global organisation led by the  chief executive ofÿcers of more than 200 leading businesses that work  together to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world.
In 2019, The Alliance to End Plastic Waste supports Renew Oceans, a localised investment and engagement project.
The ÿrst Renew  Oceans project focuses on IndiaÕs Ganges River into which more  than half a million tonnes of plastic waste is reported to be  dumpedannually.

We work with local and global non-governmental and humanitarian organisations, including BSR (Business for Social Responsibility) and  the Clean Cooking Alliance.
These groups help us address the needs  of the communities where we operate.
In 2019, we also joined the  Smart Communities Coalition, which seeks to improve the delivery of  essential services to refugees and hostcommunities.
Better access to jobs and training In Tanzania and Kenya, we supported the Employment and Skills for  Eastern Africa (or E4D/SOGA) programme in partnership with the  German, British and Norwegian governments, the European Union  and several companies.
E4D/SOGA aims to improve access to jobs  and economic opportunities for local people in natural resource-based  industries and relatedsectors.
In 2019, 7,290 people received training and 3,867 people (a third of whom were women and the majority young people) secured  employment across easternAfrica.
Since the programme started in 2015, more than 55,000 people have received training and around 15,600 people have secured employment.
More than 18,700 people have increased their income, by an average  of 235%, and about 31,130 local enterprises have increased revenues  andcompetitiveness.
ENVIRONMENTAL PARTNERS We work with partners to reduce our environmental impact, improve  areas around our operations and ensure local communities beneÿt  from ourpresence.
Together, we share our scientiÿc and conservation knowledge with industry and environmental groups and engage on  sustainabilitychallenges.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has been our global partner focusing on biodiversity policy and projects for External voice SSononja Pja Palmalm  Program Director, Employment for  Development (E4D/SOGA), GIZ ÒThe collaboration with Shell has enabled us to understand  industry needs better and to customise our skills programmes to  what industryneeds.

GIZ,  as a development agency, and international companies such as  Shell each bring different expertise and perspectives into a  partnership through which we learn from each other and thrive to  deliver better outcomes.Ó more than 20 years.
In 2019, together we started working with  European utility companiesEDFand EDP on ways to mitigate the  impact of solar and wind power projects onbiodiversity.
IUCNhas also set up independent scientiÿc panels to help us mitigate environmental impacts.
In 2019, the Western Gray Whale Advisory  Panel received a new three-year mandate to advise Sakhalin Energy  (Shell interest 27.5% minus one share) in Russia on assessing and  managing its impact on western graywhales.
IUCN and Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) have continued to collaborate with others in Nigeria to  monitor the biodiversity recovery in areas whereSPDCÕs new  remediation standard is being applied (see Spill prevention and response in Nigeria ).We also collaborate on local projects.
In 2019, Shell Oil Company partnered with the Coastal Conservation Association to help protect  the shoreline of Louisiana, USA.
To do this, we are using artiÿcial  þoating islands made from recycled plastic water bottles.
The islands,  which host around 2,500 square feet of native grasses, attract marine  life and act as a barrier against strongwaves.
Shell Development Oman continued to work with Wetlands International to support bird migration counts of the Wetlands Reserve  in Al Wusta Governorate, which includes the Barr Al Hikman  peninsula.
In 2019, the autumn migration survey results showed that  more than 200,000 birds of around 60 different species made the  intertidal wetland on the coast of Oman their home for resting and  feeding during their annualmigration.
Employee engagement We partner with Earthwatch to give Shell employees a chance to hone  their sustainability leadership skills and make a direct contribution to  scientiÿc research and global conservation efforts.
In 2019, 96  employees from 27 countries took part in Earthwatch science and  learningexpeditions.
Shell employees collect samples as part of an Earthwatch expedition helping scientists at the Schoodic Institute, Maine, USA,  understand the impacts of climate change on the localenvironment.
Through the Earth Skills Network, employees share business skills with staff in IUCN or UNESCO-protected areas.
In 2019, six employees  supported 18 staff from these organisations in protected areas,  including NigeriaÕs Gashaka-Gumti NationalPark.

Our approach to suppliers and contractors is set out in our Shell General Business Principles and Shell Supplier Principles.
These  principles cover requirements such as business integrity, health and  safety, and human rights.
Working with suppliers and contractors in  this way is crucial to being a responsible member ofsociety.
Read more about how we work with contractors and suppliers at www.shell.com/business-customers/shell-for-suppliers .In 2019, Shell spent $44.9 billion on goods and services from around 29,000 suppliersglobally.
Our suppliers and contractors are critical to our ability to run our business.
They are involved in almost every step of our operations Ð  and are often key to having a positive impact on the community and  achieving successful businessoutcomes.
Human rights We are collaborating with BP, Equinor and Total to create a standard  approach to human rights supplier assessments for the energy industry.
The aim is to make it easier and more efÿcient for suppliers to show  how they respect human rights and care for their people.
In 2019,  each organisation began using a common framework developed for  all risk-based labour rights assessments of suppliers.
We continue to  invite companies in the energy industry to join theinitiative.
The initiative supports the objectives ofUNsustainable development Goal 8 to Òpromote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic  growth, full and productive employment and decent work for allÓ.
We  also continue to support the UN Global Compact and its corporate  governance principles on humanrights.
Read more on our approach to human rights at www.shell.com/ sustainability/transparency/human-rights .
Worker welfare In 2019, we carried out an internal assurance review to assess the  design and operational robustness of our control processes to ensure SUPPLY CHAIN IN 2019 SUPPLIERS 29,000GOODS AND SERVICES $44.9billionwe fulÿl our commitment to respect human rights (see Respecting human rights ).We have detailed guidance for our project management teams that sets minimum global standards for worker welfare and respect for  people.
We continuously aim to deliver a standard of accommodation  and facilities that improves the quality of life and well-being of people  working on our projects.
This includes accommodation and facilities  that enhance their well-being and promote safe and productivework.
We conducted a review of our approach to worker welfare in 2019, including how suppliers and contractors working at our sites care for  their people.
The outcome of this review has resulted in the  development of a new chapter on worker welfare for our management  system, which we call our Health, Safety, Security, Environment and  Social Performance ControlFramework.
It will require an assessment of worker welfare risk and, where necessary, the creation of a worker welfare plan for the site, and  require that contractors and suppliers also make a worker welfare plan  for their staff.
We expect the content of worker welfare plans to cover  the areas addressed by the Building Responsibly Worker  WelfarePrinciples.
Lower-carbon supply chain We continuously work with our contractors and suppliers to ÿnd ways  for them to build lower-carbon solutions into our supply chains.
For  instance, we are installing performance optimisation software and  battery storage systems on our contracted offshore supply vessels to  reduce fuel consumption and lower greenhouse gasemissions.
In Louisiana, USA, we have been playing an important part in the state's coastal economy for more than acentury.
NON-OPERATED VENTURES Shell often works in joint ventures with national and other international  energy companies.
These organisations bring important skills and  experience to a jointventure.
More than half of ShellÕs joint ventures are not operated by Shell.
We do not have direct control over how these ventures embed  sustainability in their operations but seek instead to offer our support  and exert a positive inþuence on theiroperations.
For example, our representatives and Shell-appointed board members in a joint venture require our partners to adopt the Shell commitment  and policy on health, safety, security, environment and social  performance (HSSE & SP), or one materially equivalent to our own.
They are also expected to put in place standards to adequately  address HSSE & SPrisks.
1.Introduction2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 69Shell 2019 Sustainability Report When these joint ventures implement our HSSE & SP Control Framework Ð designed to help ensure our projects and assets are safe  Ð or a similar approach, Shell teams carry out independent audits or  participate in the joint ventureÕs own auditing programmes where  possible.
We also offer to review the effectiveness of the frameworkÕs  implementation, with the review overseen by the joint ventureÕs board  ofdirectors.
We periodically evaluate the health, safety, environmental and community risks of our joint ventures.
If a joint venture is falling below  expectations, plans will be put in place, in agreement with the other  partners, to improveperformance.
Reducing energy and CO 2emissionsOman is one of the countries where Shell has been partnering and working closely with the government and other companies  fordecades.
For example, we are helping Petroleum Development Oman (PDO; Shell interest 34%) save energy and reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2)emissions.
In 2019, PDO adopted our energy efÿciency surveillance  tool at 11 production sites.
The tool, which spots unusual energy usage  so it can be corrected, has so far saved 46 megawatts and lowered  CO 2emissions by 275,000 tonnes a year.
It has also cut associated gas þaring at one site by 30,000 cubic metres a day, which adds up  to annual savings of about $24million.
PDO plans to install the system  at all 26 production sites by2022.
Read more at Methane emissions andEnergy efÿciency in our operations .DIVESTING RESPONSIBLY We continue working to reshape our global portfolio to drive growth  and resilience, and carry out due diligence on potential buyers when  divesting parts of ourbusiness.
In 2018, we successfully completed our three-year $30billion divestment programme and our efforts to refresh and upgrade our  assets willcontinue.
In 2019, we completed divestments of around $5billion.
See the Shell Annual Report 2019 fordetails.
We have a well-established, systematic and assured method of  assessing risk in divestments.
This includes using in-house and external  experts, where appropriate, to conduct checks and examine key  attributes of potentialbuyers.
These attributes include their ÿnancial strength; operating culture; health, safety, security and environment (HSSE) policies; and  approach to ethics and compliance.
We also consider risk and people  management processes and standards; community liaison practices;  and social investmentprogrammes.
Applicable attributes are assessed against ShellÕs policies, as well as the likely requirements of relevant laws andregulations.
Divestments are often subject to the approval of regulatory authorities, which includes potential buyersÕHSSEcapacity andcapability.

POWERING NIGERIAÕS ECONOMY In 2019, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd  (SPDC), the operator of theSPDCJoint Venture (SPDC interest 30%),  focused on restoring and repairing wells and pipelines in the Niger  Delta to restart oil and gas production.
Some wells that were closed  for about 20 years are producing again.
The Trans Ramos pipeline is  also supplying oil and gas for export after being shut due to leaks in  2018.
The result is an increase in production of nearly 10% on2018.
SPDC also continued to make progress on developing several large gas projects that are key to eliminating continuous þaring from its  operations.
Since 2002, þaring has been reduced by 90%.
Gas that  was once þared is now captured and processed for domestic and  international gas markets.
Gas is sent for the export market as liqueÿed  natural gas (LNG) or channelled into the domestic Nigerian gas market.
Here, it displaces diesel generators to provide cleaner, reliable and  affordable power for industrial and commercialcustomers.
In 2019, SPDC made signiÿcant progress with new gas production from two large projects: Southern Swamp and Forcados Yokri.
Gas  from the Southern Swamp is intended for export asLNG, providing  revenue to the government and opportunities forexpansion.
Gas from Forcados is expected to be sent to the domestic Nigerian market to provide clean reliable power for more than 100 industrial  and commercial customers through Shell Nigeria Gas Ltd. Customers  include a large þoat glass manufacturer, a pharmaceutical factory as  well as large commercial market zones and local and international  consumer goodscompanies.
SPDC has taken big strides in building what is expected to be the largest gas facility in the country at the Assa North-Ohaji South  project.
When completed, the processed gas is expected to further  boost gas supplies to industrial and commercial customers in Nigeria  and boost economic prosperity for the growingpopulation.
Flaring fromSPDCincreased slightly in 2019 due to the construction of these gas facilities.
Once fully functioning, the facilitiesÕ overall  contribution will be signiÿcant in eliminating continuous operational  þaring inNigeria.
EXPANDING IN DEEP-WATER OIL AND GAS  Unlocking the oil and gas resources in the deep waters of the Gulf of  Guinea can help meet growing energy demand in Nigeria and  international markets.
Shell works with local Nigerian companies and  develops the skills and experience of Nigerianemployees.
The Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo), operator of the Bonga ÿeld, produces 12.5% of NigeriaÕs oil  production.
This generates signiÿcant and stable revenue for the  government through taxes, royalties and levies.
In 2019,SNEPCo  continued to use its knowledge, experience and proven deep-water  technologies to unlock new resources safely and efÿciently.
For  example, the company used a specialised twin-deck drillship over the  Bonga ÿeld to reduce the cost and time to complete a well-drilling  operation.
This involved a technique known as single trip completion,  which combined ÿne instruments and careful planning.
It was  developed with Schlumberger and used for the ÿrst time anywhere in  the world inNigeria.
The Tunu gas-gathering project is part of the Southern Swamp Associated Gas Solutions initiative and is designed to manage  natural gas produced along withoil.

The company won the maiden Shell Top Ten Innovators AwardÕs Outstanding Achievement Award in 2018.
ÒThere is often a paper-thin line between success and failure in  business, especially for a start-up.
The training, support systems  and valuable networks I have gained over the last 5 years,  courtesy of Shell LiveWIRE, have gone a long way to ensure that  my business start-up, De-Rabacon Plastics, isthriving.
ÒShellÕs approach on supporting local enterprises to grow and excel is enabling us to scale up our business and focus on  designing eco-friendly, energy-efÿcient and affordable products.
Today my organisation employs 16 people and has recycled over  800,000 tonnes of plastic waste.
We plan to achieve two million  tonnes by the end of 2020.Ó In 2019, SNEPCo continued to take steps to add production in deep  water.
The company invited contractors to bid to develop the Bonga  South West Aparo ÿeld.
The projectÕs ÿrst phase will include  developing around 20 deep-water wells and subsea infrastructure,  and building a þoating production, storage and ofþoadingvessel.
CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY Shell Companies in Nigeria continue to support the development of  local communities and companies as part of their contribution to the  economy.
These companies also work with others such as the  government to run social investment programmes.
In 2019, Shell-  operated ventures contributed $40 million in social investment  projects, mainly in enterprise support, education, health care and road  safety.
In 2019, Shell companies awarded contracts worth more than $1.1billion to Nigerian ÿrms and helped to developinfrastructure.
SPDC worked with around 286 Nigerian companies and about 3,000 Nigerians to deliver the Southern Swamp Associated Gas Solution  project.
The contracted companies provided services including  building processing facilities, laying pipelines and providing  commercial offshoredivers.
SNEPCo's social performance programme involved building and equipping a chemistry laboratory at the Eruku Integrated Ultra-  Modern Science Laboratory in Kwara State,Nigeria.
IMPROVING HEALTH CARE We run various health care projects in Nigeria, often in partnership  with local authorities or development bodies.
We aim to improve  access for local people to health care and treatments for diseases  such as cancer.
We also have health facilities for employees,  contractors and, where possible, localpeople.
Access to health care is provided through a community health insurance scheme, which was set up in 2010 by SPDC, Rivers State  government and local communities.
Since 2010, more than 67,000  people haveenrolled.
The scheme provides access to the Obio Cottage Hospital in Port Harcourt, which remains one of the most visited health facilities in the  Niger Delta.
SPDC set up the hospital in 2010.
It specialises in  maternity health care and in 2019 was the birthplace of about 300  babies each month.
The hospital includes a vaccination clinic,  screening to prevent the passing of HIV from mother to child and an  operatingtheatre.
In 2019, SNEPCo collaborated with the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health to improve cancer care.
They invested around $1.5 million to  upgrade the National Hospital Abuja.
The funds went towards the  procurement and installation of a world-class radiotherapy machine  within the facility and medical stafftraining.
TACKLING PLASTIC WASTE In 2019, Shell Companies in Nigeria announced plans to reduce  single-use plastic at facilities by at least 50% by 2020.
They began by  introducing alternatives such as water reÿll stations and reusable  water bottles.
Some sites made signiÿcant progress, including the  Gbaran-Ubie facility that reduced single-use plastic by 90% in 2019, a  drop from around 10,000 1.5 litre bottles a month to 1,000.

OPERATING SAFELY The safety of employees and contractors in Nigeria remains our top  priority.
Shell companies aim to achieve no harm to people and no  leaks across operations.
We refer to this as our Goal Zeroambition.
In 2019, we focused on three safety areas: improving how managers stop unsafe work in their teams, preventing objects being dropped  from height Ð a common hazard in the industry Ð and marinesafety.
Sadly, in 2019, two contractors working for the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd died when a vessel they were travelling on capsized in bad weather.
An investigation into the  incident isongoing.
In 2019, there were 16 cases of personal injuries that required medical treatment or time off work at Shell Companies inNigeria.
Shell Companies in Nigeria continue to contribute to the safety of communities around facilities by responding to third-party ÿres and  emergencies.
In 2019, Shell companies responded to 44 of these  incidents, including an overturned fuel tanker and a search and rescue  operation on a collapsed hotel building under construction, both in  PortHarcourt.
Fireÿghters from Shell Nigeria Emergency Services take part in emergency training in PortHarcourt.

The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC), the operator of theSPDCJoint Venture (SPDC interest 30%), is run  according to the same technical standards as other Shell companies  globally.
SPDC is working to eliminate spills from operational activities,  remediate past spills and prevent spills caused by crude oil theft,  sabotage of pipelines or illegal oil reÿning.
These illegal activities  accounted for 95% of SPDCJVspill incidents in2019.
To reduce the number of operational spills, SPDC is focused on implementing its ongoing work programme to appraise, maintain and  replace key sections of pipelines and þow lines.
In 2019,SPDC  completed 30 kilometres of new þow lines, bringing the total to  around 1,330 kilometres over the last eightyears.
These efforts have signiÿcantly reduced operational spills to seven incidents and around 0.03 thousand tonnes of crude oil in 2019,  compared with 15 incidents and 0.4 thousand tonnes in 2018.
This  represents a year-on-year reduction of more than 90% byvolume.
However, the challenge of preventing spills relating to sabotage and theft by third partiesremains.
In 2019, there were 156 [A]sabotage- and theft-related spills of more than 100 kilograms, up from 109 in 2018.
This is due to factors such as  increased availability of our production facilities after a major export  line repair in 2017; crude theft activities in an election year; and the  higher price of crude oil and reÿned products, which is seen as an  opportunity for more illegal reÿning.
Spilled volumes relating to  sabotage and theft increased to around 2.0 thousand tonnes of  crudeoil.
We continued to implement operational improvements to shorten our response time, and improve relations with communities.
There were  also ongoing commitments from government agencies to tacklespills.
SPDCÕs average [B]time to complete clean-up of free and/or residual spilled oil has decreased from 13 days in 2016 to seven days in 2019.
For example, closer engagement with communities has helped SPDC  to access spill locations more quickly, meaning, on average, joint  investigations now commence within three days in 2019 compared  with six days in2016.
SPDC is working to minimise the impact of third-party incidents and spills.
It works with government agencies, non-governmental organisations and communities to proactively prevent and minimise  spills from illegalactivity.
This work includes using simpliÿed pipeline visuals and maps, which help to better target our response to third-party interference in our  operations.
Since 2017,SPDChas removed more than 523 illegal  theft points.
Illegal theft points are identiÿed by daily overþights and  on-the-ground inspections.
The company has also implemented anti-theft protection mechanisms, such as anti-tamper locks and steel cages for wellheads.
By the end of  2019, 301 cages had been installed and around 80 more are planned  for 2020 that will all come with CCTV technology.
In 2019, three  breaches of the cages were recorded out of 300 attempts.
The volume  of wellhead-related crude oil losses decreased signiÿcantly, from  30,000 barrels a day in 2016 to 1,000 barrels a day in 2019.
Regardless of the cause, SPDC cleans up and remediates areas impacted by spills that come from its facilities.
In the case of  operational spills, SPDC also pays compensation to communities  impacted by the spill.
Once the clean-up and remediation are  completed, the work is inspected, and, if satisfactory, approved and  certiÿed by Nigerian governmentregulators.
As well as responding to recent spill incidents, SPDC continues to identify and remediate legacy spill locations.
In 2019, 130 sites were  remediated and 123 certiÿed by Nigerian government regulators,  compared with 116 certiÿed and 45 remediated in2018.
More details on spill prevention and response in Nigeria can be found at www.shell.com.ng/environment andwww.shell.com.ng/oil-spills .
[A] In addition, there were four separate sites where crude oil was released from a tanker truck onto SPDCÕs pipeline right of way.
The source of the crude is not known and could not be linked directly to any unique or identiÿable SPDC assets or spill points.
[B] Averages exclude sites where signiÿcant delays were encountered outside of our operational control due to security, community disturbance or þoodconditions.
1.Introduction2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 75Shell 2019 Sustainability Report COLLABORATING WITH THE IUCN SPDChas worked with the International Union for Conservation of  Nature (IUCN) since 2012 to enhance remediation techniques and  protect biodiversity at sites affected by oil spills in SPDCÕs areas of  operation in the Niger Delta.
This work includes using bioremediation,  a process that uses micro-organisms to naturally break down, and  ultimately remove, oilcontamination.
The Niger Delta Panel, an independent scientiÿc advisor, has also provided input on oil spill response and remediation of soil and  groundwater contamination.
Based on this, SPDC strengthened its  approach in thisarea.
In 2019, SPDC andIUCNjoined forces on the Niger Delta Biodiversity Technical Advisory Group, which also includes representatives from  the Nigerian Conservation Foundation and Wetlands International.
The groups will continue to work together to monitor biodiversity  recovery of remediated sites.
Four sites have been assessed and  selected as pilot sites for monitoring.
These sites represent three  ecosystems in the Niger Delta: land, seasonal swamp andswamp.
SPDC also works with a range of stakeholders in the Niger Delta to build greater trust in spill response and clean-up processes.
Local  communities take part in the remediation work for operational spills.
In  certain instances, some non-governmental organisations have also  participated in joint investigation visits along with government  regulators, SPDC and members of impacted communities to establish  the cause and volume of oilspilled.
SPDC has also implemented several initiatives and partnerships to raise awareness of the negative impact of crude oil theft and illegal oil  reÿning.
Examples include community-based pipeline surveillance and  the promotion of alternative livelihoods through ShellÕs þagship youth  entrepreneurship programme, ShellLiveWIRE.
CLEAN-UP IN BODO In 2015, SPDC Ð on behalf of the SPDC JV Ð and the Bodo community  signed a memorandum of understanding granting SPDC access to  begin the clean-up of areas affected by two operational spills in 2008.
As part of this initiative, two contractors were selected to conduct the  clean-up, overseen by an independent projectdirector.
After two years of signiÿcant engagement with the Bodo community  and others, managed by the Bodo Mediation Initiative, the ÿrst phase  of clean-up activities started in September 2017.
The clean-up consists  of three phases: 1) removal of free-phase surface oil, 2) remediation of  soil and 3) planting of mangroves and monitoring.
The ÿrst phase was  completed in August2018.
The contract procurement process for phase two was completed in 2019, with remediation contractors and consultants selected.
Local  communities were then contacted.
Around 800 community workers  have been medically checked, assessed for their swimming ability, to  ensure they can safely respond to potential incidents in rivers and  creeks, and trained to International Maritime Organisation oil spill  response levels one and two.
Field remediation activities started in  November2019.
Phase two (remediation of soil) is expected to take around 18 months.
However, it will only be successful if the repeated re-contamination of  cleaned-up sites from illegal third-party activitystops.
CLEAN-UP EFFORTS IN OGONILAND SPDC is working with the relevant stakeholders to implement the 2011  UNEnvironmental Programme (UNEP) Report on Ogoniland.
Over the  last eight years, SPDC has taken action on all, and completed most, of  theUNEPrecommendations addressed speciÿcally to it as operator of  the jointventure.
The UNEP report recommended the creation of an Ogoni Trust Fund with $1 billion capital, to be co-funded by the Nigerian government,  the SPDC JV and other operators in the area.
The SPDC JV remains  fully committed to contributing $900 million of the $1 billion over ÿve  years as its share of the fund and made $10 million available in 2017  to help set up the Hydrocarbon Pollution and Remediation Project  (HYPREP), an agency established by the federal government to lead  the clean-up effort.
In 2018, the SPDCJVdeposited a further $170  million into the escrow account to fund HYPREPÕs activities, to  complete its ÿrst-year contribution of $180 million.
In 2019, the SPDC  JV released a further $180 million contribution to fundHYPREP.

NAM continues to help people living in  Groningen who regrettably have been affected by earthquakes linked  to gasproduction.
In 2019, the Dutch government decided to reduce NAMÕs production from the Groningen ÿeld to zero by 2022, eight years earlier than  previously stated.
NAM is working with the government on plans to  close down production as quickly and safely as possible while  considering the energy security of the Netherlands.
NAM is safely  decommissioning its facilities and consulting with local municipalities  to plan for the future of these productionsites.
HELPING LOCAL COMMUNITIES NAM continues to address the impact of earthquakes on people in  Groningen, including supporting a programme to strengthen houses  and public buildings, when asked to do so by the responsible  authorities.
The programme is delivered by the local and federal  government collaboration called the National Coordinator  forGroningen.
NAM has supported several socio-economic initiatives for the Groningen region.
For example, helping develop a social economic  board that creates new business opportunities and jobs.
NAM also  runs the Livability and Sustainability programme to upgrade several  community centres with more efÿcient power, such as solar panels and  LEDlighting.
Safe and responsible decommissioning of surface infrastructure at gas production facilities is a priority forNAM.
Groningen, NetherlandsExternal voice ChrChrisistiaan Wtiaan Wiepkiepkemaema Member of the community association for  Steendam village, Groningen Christiaan Wiepkema is a member of the community association  for Steendam village in Groningen that has set up an energy co-  operative.
This co-operative is in discussions to convert NAM gas  facilities in Siddeburen to renewableenergy.
ÒSelf-reliance and creativity come naturally to us in Steendam.
When we needed fast internet, and the authorities couldnÕt help, a  group of us dug trenches, laid cables and installed a superfast  network.
Now we have formed an energy co-operative with  around 200people.
ÒWeÕve had NAMÕs gas production nearby for years, and of course seen the impact of earthquakes, but we got thinking about  life after this.
A co-operative gives us freedom and ensures different  opinions are heard on important decisions.
We are building a solar  farm and a wind park to obtain green electricity for our entire  village.
We are also looking to replace the gas that powers our  village with renewableenergy.
ÒWe want to use hydrogen to store and transport this renewable energy, but installing a hydrogen network is complicated and not  feasible for a small village.
So, we are talking to Economic Board  Groningen and NAM about using the nearby gas facilities at  Siddeburen.
It seems like a waste to leave all that infrastructure  unused in the ground.Ó 1.Introduction2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 77Shell 2019 Sustainability Report HANDLING DAMAGE CLAIMS NAM is settling outstanding damage claims for affected residents,  although it is not involved in the administration of these claims.
All  claims are now handled by independent public organisations set up  under a new policy announced by the Dutch government in2018.
NAM was, and will remain, responsible for all earthquake-related costs.
Shell has provided a guarantee that it will fund its share of  thesecosts.
PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE In 2019, NAM began decommissioning the surface infrastructure at its  gas production facilities in Groningen.
Safe and responsible  decommissioning is a priority for NAM.
This includes restoring the sites  and surroundings in line with the requirements of landowners and  relevant legislation, while taking NAMÕs own environmental standards  intoaccount.
NAM began the ÿrst phase of the permanent closure of the Groningen ÿeld by decommissioning the surface facilities in Ten Post, a small  village in north-east Groningen, and one of 20 production sites to be  decommissioned.
Production at Ten Post stopped in February 2018  and plugging of the gas wells was completed in March 2019.
By  2022, NAM plans for all wells in Ten Post to beabandoned.
NAM is proactively discussing plans with neighbours of the production  location, the local municipality and the Economic Board Groningen to  reuse locations like Ten Post for renewable energyfacilities.
In 2019, NAM began decommissioning the surface gas facilities in Ten Post, one of 20 production sites to bedecommissioned.

We are increasing our investment in protecting or developing natural ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands and wetlands, to capture more  carbon from the atmosphere and help our customers offset their  emissions using carboncredits.
A joint study by several universities and non-governmental organisations, including The Nature Conservancy and Wetlands  International, found that nature-based solutions could reduce carbon  dioxide (CO 2) emissions by more than11billiontonnes a year by 2030.
This is equivalent to the combined annual CO 2emissions of the USA and the EuropeanUnion.
Shell recognises that nature-based solutions are a tool that can only ever complement, and not replace, others we are deploying to help  society move to a low-carbonfuture.
Nature-based solutions also help deliver many other beneÿts, including improvements in biodiversity, water quality, þood protection  andlivelihoods.
Investing in nature is one of our tools to help us achieve our ambition to reduce the Net Carbon Footprint of the energy products we sell by  around half by 2050, in step with societyÕs progress to align with the  goals of the ParisAgreement.
In the Netherlands, we are working with the Dutch state forestry service to plant more than5milliontrees over the next 12years.
Our reforestation project in Spain is part of a growing international effort to prevent the destruction of forests, increase reforestation and  restore degradedland.
We will also reforest 300 hectares of degraded land in Spain as part of an agreement with Land Life Company.
Between April 2019 and  January 2020, we planted around 260,000 trees for theproject.
In the UK, we are working with the government in Scotland to generate carbon credits by helping to plant or regenerate around  1milliontrees over the next ÿveyears.
1.Introduction2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 79Shell 2019 Sustainability Report In Queensland, Australia, we are restoring 800 hectares of endangeredwoodland.
CARBON-NEUTRAL DRIVING AND TRANSPORT In 2019, we started to offer customers nature-based carbon credits to  offset theCO 2emissions generated by the extraction, reÿning, distribution and use of the Shell fuel they buy.
We launched the  programme at around 400 service stations in the Netherlands and  about 1,000 service stations in the UK.
We also offer nature-based carbon credits to business customers operating heavy- and light-duty þeets in 10 countries across Europe  andAsia.
We delivered the worldÕs ÿrst carbon-neutral liqueÿed natural gas cargoes to Tokyo Gas and GS Energy.
We used nature-based carbon  credits to compensate the CO 2emissions generated from exploration and production to use by the consumer.
The cargoes provided enough  carbon-neutral energy to power nearly 300,000 homes for ayear.
We buy our carbon credits from a global portfolio of nature-based projects.
These projects are certiÿed to standards, such as the Veriÿed  Carbon Standard and the Climate, Community and  BiodiversityStandard.
We believe that nature-based solutions are a critical tool in support of societyÕs efforts to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Accelerating the pace of deployment will require collaboration  between governments, industry and investors, and widersociety.

We also increasingly  work to avoid waste by ensuring what we use is designed to last  longer and to be reused, repurposed orrecycled.
BOOSTING REFINERY AND CHEMICAL PLANT EFFICIENCY We are investing in co-generation plants that provide our reÿneries and  chemical plants with on-site power in the form of both electricity and  recycled heat.
We are also helping communities near us to reduce  emissions by passing on waste heat so residents rely less on the  powergrid.
In Rotterdam, the Netherlands, waste heat from our Pernis reÿnery helps warm about 16,000 homes, helping to avoid around 35,000 tonnes of  carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions a year.
In the USA, we are building a 250 megawatt (MW) co-generation power plant at our Pennsylvania  chemicals facility that will also supply electricity to localhomes.
We have reduced fuel consumption by about 40% and air emissions by around 20-25% at our Appomattox platform in the US Gulf of  Mexico by using a combined-cycle power plant.
This operates far more  efÿciently by extracting energy that would otherwise be wasted as  exhaust heat from a regular powerplant.
Installing a more efÿcient power plant at the Appomattox deep- water oil and gas project in the USA has helped cut fuel  consumption by around 40% and air emissions by about 20-25%.
1.Introduction2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 81Shell 2019 Sustainability Report In Germany, our Rhineland reÿnery is building a modernised power plant that is expected to improve energy efÿciency and lead to a  reduction of 100,000 tonnes ofCO 2emissions a year.
We are also building a hydrogen electrolysis unit at the Rhineland site to generate  hydrogen from electricity rather than natural gas, which will help to  further reduce CO 2emissions.
REDUCING ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION  At our lubricant plants, we are using technology to help track and  reduce electricity consumption.
For example, in 2019, we began using  a monitoring system at our Nangang, Zhapu and Zhuhai blending  plants in China.
This is a web-based tool that identiÿes waste and  opportunities to improve energy efÿciency in realtime.
We piloted the tool at our Tianjin lubricant plant in China in 2018 and the result was an 8.5% reduction in electricity consumption compared  to 2017.
We are planning to introduce the tool morewidely.
SOLAR ENERGY AT SITES We are increasing solar power at our own ofÿces, retail sites,  distribution terminals, reÿneries and offshore platforms.
In 2019, we installed solar panels at seven lubricant plants in China, India, Italy, Singapore and Switzerland.
Combined, the panels are  expected to generate more than 7,500 MW an hour of electricity a  year and can avoid around 4,500 tonnes of CO 2-equivalent emissions a year, which is equivalent to taking about 2,600 cars off theroad.
Our lubricant oil blending plant in Taloja, India, is now one of seven of our lubricants facilities around the world that beneÿt from  solarpower.
The solar energy generated will be used to help power operations, lower operating costs and reduce our reliance on the powergrid.
ENERGY INTENSITY PERFORMANCE The main metric we use to measure our performance is energy  intensity: the amount of energy consumed for every unit ofoutput.
The reÿning energy intensity index in 2019 was 94.4 compared with 94.3 in2018.
In 2019, we moved from Chemical Energy Index to chemicals steam  cracker energy intensity (measured in gigajoules per tonne of high  value chemical production (GJ/tonne HVC)) as a primary measure of  energy intensity for our steam cracker units.
Chemical steam cracker  energy intensity in 2019 was 19.7 GJ/tonne HVC, up from 18.3 GJ/  tonne HVC in 2018, mainly as a result of turnarounds at three of  oursites.

In 2019, the overall energy intensity for the production of oil and gas in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses (excluding liqueÿed  natural gas (LNG) and gas-to-liquids (GTL)) increased slightly  compared with2018.
We expect it will be difÿcult to maintain the energy intensity levels of recent years, as existing ÿelds age and new production comes from  more energy-intensive sources.
This may increase our upstream energy  intensity over time.

Today, we continue to produce gas and hone our liqueÿed natural gas (LNG) expertise through deploying technologies in onshore and  offshoreactivities.
We work with partners to responsibly deliver energy by keeping safety, communities and the environment at the heart of ourprojects.
Visit www.shell.com.au to read more on Shell inAustralia.
CLEANER ENERGY FUTURE We are working to play our part in the transition to a low-carbon  future and Australia is central to this effort.
One way to do this is to  start to decarbonise the electricity sector through investments in  renewable sources, such as solar or windgeneration.
We are building our ÿrst industrial-scale solar project in Australia in Queensland, which is designed to generate around 120 megawatts of  solar electricity from about 400,000 photovoltaicpanels.
Through our acquisition of sonnen, a leader in smart home and business solar energy storage systems, we are selling batteries in  Australia that ensure customers with solar panels have a constant  supply of clean electricity.
Customers can store their surplus solar  power during the day and use it atnight.
Shell Australia has also taken a 49% equity stake in ESCO Paciÿc, one of AustraliaÕs most successful developers of utility-scale solarfarms.
DELIVERING NATURAL GAS RESPONSIBLY Gas is the cleanest-burning hydrocarbon and is an abundant, secure  and readily available source ofenergy.
Recognition of the role ofLNGcontinues to grow as the world tackles poor air quality and climate change.
Global demand for LNG has  tripled since 2000.
There are now 42 countries that import LNG, up  from 10 at the start of 2000.
Shell supplies 76 customers in 27 of  thesecountries.
We are working in Australia to unlock its rich onshore and offshore gas resources to help meet this energy demand.
For example, the  Shell-operated QGC project in Queensland, Eastern Australia,  produces natural gas from the Surat Basin and supplies domestic and  international markets.
In 2019, QGC shipped its 500th cargo of LNG from its plant on CurtisIsland.
We are working hard to deliver energy in Australia safely and responsibly.
For example, we ran a safety programme at QGC focused  on our wells business that improved its safety performance, recording a  40% decrease in total recordable case frequency since the programme  was introduced in 2018 (see Process safety ).
We also ensure we have AustraliaQGC produces natural gas and supplies it to domestic and internationalmarkets.
the necessary resources to deal with spills, leaks, ÿres and explosions, both offshore andonshore.
We are also expanding the role of natural gas as it has signiÿcant advantages when used to produce electricity alongside renewable  sources of energy.
Gas-powered turbines, which ramp up and ramp  down quickly, can compensate for dips in solar or wind supply as well  as rapidly respond to surges indemand.
In 2019, Shell Energy Australia acquired ERM Power, a leading commercial and industrial electricity retailer in the country with two  gas-ÿred generationplants.
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE Australia is central to our investments in carbon capture and  storageprojects.
We are a partner in the Chevron-operated Gorgon LNGCCSproject in Australia (Shell interest 25%), which started up in August 2019 and  is the world's largest CCS project.
At full capacity, Gorgon is expected  to capture up to4milliontonnes of CO 2each year.
It is expected that 100milliontonnes ofCO 2will be captured and stored over the life of the project.
During the pre-start-up and commissioning checks of the 1.Introduction2.Responsible business 3.Sustainable energy future 4.Contribution  to society 5.Special  reports 6.Our  performance  data 83Shell 2019 Sustainability Report injection project, some issues were identiÿed that needed to be resolved before injectionstarted.
BIODIVERSITY AND NATURAL SOLUTIONS We carefully consider and aim to respond to any potential impacts our  Australian activities may have on biodiversity andecosystems.
For example, QGC continues to manage the 10,000-hectare Valkyrie property, a large area of open woodland, as part of its strategy to  offset its carbon emissions and impact on biodiversity.
This includes  using nature-based solutions that protect or redevelop ecosystems and  help us offer our customers the opportunity to offset their emissions  using carboncredits.
The Shell-operated QGC natural gas project in Central Queensland manages the 10,000-hectare Valkyrie property, a large area of  open woodland, as a carbon and biodiversityoffset.
Valkyrie is home to Freyja, Shell AustraliaÕs ÿrst nature-based solutions project.
Freyja is an 800-hectare endangered native forest  regeneration project that was registered under the Carbon Credits  (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 in 2019.
Over the next 25 years,  Freyja is expected to sequester 90,000 tonnes ofCO 2equivalent and generate Australian Carbon CreditUnits.
Valkyrie is also home to several at-risk species, including the Greater Glider marsupial.
In 2019, we developed effective biodiversity  strategies to help protect the glider and other species.
We also  developed a signiÿcant biodiversity managementplan.
In 2019, we engaged with local residents near our QGC natural gas facility in Central Queensland,Australia.
BOOSTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Our contribution to Australian society comes in many forms.
It includes  employing more than 2,000 people directly and supporting 21,800  jobs.
Many of these people live, work and raise their families close to  ouroperations.
We are also helping to create employment opportunities for indigenous peoples through our local content and skills development  programmes.
For example, Shell Australia partners with the  Wirrpanda Foundation in Western Australia to help improve the  physical ÿtness and self-conÿdence of unemployed Aboriginal job  seekers.
The programme has so far helped 130 people securejobs.
We have partnered with Queensland Museum to connect teachers with science specialists from the museum to build their understanding  of science, technology, engineering and mathematicssubjects.
We also aim to support local businesses inside and outside the energyindustry.
For example, our Emerging Exporters programme helps agribusinesses in Queensland ÿnd new domestic and international customers.
It connects them with leading food experts in the region, who provide  mentoring and coaching through workshops and tailored  trademissions.
The programme helped family-owned cattle farm Four Daughters Premium Black Angus export its beef from Meandarra in rural Queensland toChina.

We support  transparency and share information and data in this report and on  www.shell.com .There are inherent limitations to the accuracy of environmental and social data.
We recognise that our data will be affected by these  limitations, so we continue to improve data integrity by strengthening  our internalcontrols.
We provide all non-ÿnancial data in this report on a 100% basis for companies and joint ventures where we are the operator.
Environmental data pertain to direct Shell operations unless otherwise  stated.
We report in this way, in line with industry practice, because  these are the data we can directly manage and affect through  operational improvements.
We refer to the number of people  employed or contracted on a full-time equivalentbasis.
Operations acquired or divested during 2019 are included only for the period in which we operated these assets.
Other data are collected  from external sources, employee surveys and other internal sources as  indicated.
Data marked in the social data table come from an internal  survey completed by the senior Shell representative in each country.
The accuracy of environmental and social data may be lower than that  of data obtained through our ÿnancialsystems.
We only include data in this report for 2019 that were conÿrmed by the end of March 2020.
If incidents are reclassiÿed or conÿrmed, or if  signiÿcant data changes occur after preparation of this report, they  will be updated in the following yearÕspublication.
ASSURANCE  We have clear standards and reporting requirements for our health,  safety, security, environment and social performance (HSSE &  SP)data.
Shell facilities are required to adopt these standards, which deÿne management roles and responsibilities, the scope of data at facilities  and how data are calculated and collected.
These standards are part  of our HSSE & SP ControlFramework.
To ensure we provide accurate information, our assurance process of HSSE & SP data is also a key element of theHSSE & SPControl  Framework.
The process þows from the facility all the way up to group  level.
Some examples of the assurance mechanisms in this processare: self-assessments at the facility level; internal audits at all levels of Shell; quarterly reviews and assessments of the data at all levels; an annual series of meetings between leaders at group level and  senior business managers to discuss outcomes and reporting  parameters; and formal sign-off by ShellÕs senior country leaders.
The Report Review Panel of independent experts helps make sure our  reporting is balanced, relevant and responsive to stakeholdersÕinterests.
LloydÕs Register Quality Assurance Ltd has provided limited assurance of our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions data for 2019.

The data are calculated using locally regulated methods where they exist.
Where there is no locally regulated method, the data are calculated using the 2009 API Compendium, which is the recognised industry standard under the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.
There are inherent limitations to the accuracy of such data.
Oil and gas industry  guidelines (IPIECA/API/IOGP) indicate that several sources of uncertainty can contribute to the overall uncertainty of a corporate emissions inventory.
We have estimated the overall  uncertainty of our direct GHG emissions to be around 2%.
2015-2019 emissions are calculated using Global Warming Potential factors from the IPCCÕs Fourth Assessment Report.
Data  for prior years were calculated using Global Warming Potential factors from the IPCCÕs Second AssessmentReport.
[B]These emissions were calculated using the market-based method in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and ReportingStandard.
[C]The term upstream in this context includes assets and activities from our Upstream and Integrated Gasbusinesses.
[D]Nigeria includes SPDC onshore operations (0.6million tonnes þared in 2019) and SNEPCo offshore operations (0.02million tonnes þared in 2019).
[E]Flaring from Prelude in Australia and from Malaysia amounted to 0.7 and 0.1million tonnes of hydrocarbons respectively in2019.
[F]Methodology was updated in 2012.
Data for prior years are not directlycomparable.
[G]Data are indexed to 2002, based on Solomon Associates Energy Intensity Indexmethodology.
[H]All spill volumes and numbers are for spills of more than 100kilograms.
[I]As of the end of March2020, there was one spill under investigation in Nigeria that may result inadjustments.
[J]All sabotage- and theft-related spills have occurred in Nigeria except in 2016 (0.001 thousand tonnes) and 2015 (0.005 thousand tonnes).
We have updated the number of sabotage spills for 2018 and 2019 as published in our 2019 Annual Report following a review of thedata.
[K]Nigeria includes SPDC onshore operations and SNEPCo offshore operations.
A single spill at the Bonga ÿeld offshore Nigeria amounted to 4.8 thousand tonnes in2011.
[L]Nigeria includes SPDC onshore operations (seven operational spills in 2019) and SNEPCo offshore operations (zero operational spills in 2019).
[M]2017 data reþect four spills caused by Hurricane Harvey in theUSA.
[N]Freshwater ÿgures do not include once-through coolingwater.
[O]In 2019, we sent waste off-site for recycling or reuse, or sold over 400 thousand tonnes of material that would otherwise have been disposed of aswaste.
[P]We have updated some of our historical ÿgures following a review of thedata.
[Q]2019 numbers reþect emissions in CO 2equivalents.
Prior yearsÕ data only reþected CO 2emissions.

This measure comprises proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and businesses, joint ventures and associates, and other Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream investments in equity  securities, adjusted onto an accruals basis and for any share consideration received or contingent consideration initially recognised upon the  related divestment, as well as proceeds from sale of interests in entities while retaining control (for example, proceeds from sale of interests in  Shell Midstream Partners, L.P.).
The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities.
In this report ÒShellÓ, ÒShell GroupÓ and ÒRoyal Dutch ShellÓ are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries in  general.
Likewise, the words ÒweÓ, ÒusÓ and ÒourÓ are also used to refer to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who  work for them.
These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities.
ÔÔSubsidiariesÕÕ, ÒShell  subsidiariesÓ and ÒShell companiesÓ as used in this report refer to entities over which Royal Dutch Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control.
Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as Òjoint venturesÓ and Òjoint operationsÓ,  respectively.Entities over which Shell has signiÿcant inþuence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as ÒassociatesÓ.
The term ÒShell  interestÓ is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint  arrangement, after exclusion of all third-partyinterest.
Also, in this report we may refer to ShellÕs ÒNet Carbon FootprintÓ, which includes ShellÕs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliersÕ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customersÕ carbon emissions associated with their use  of the energy products we sell.
Shell only controls its own emissions.
But, to support society in achieving the Paris Agreement goals, we aim to  help such suppliers and consumers to likewise lower their emissions.
The use of the term ShellÕs ÒNet Carbon FootprintÓ is for convenience only  and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell or itssubsidiaries.
